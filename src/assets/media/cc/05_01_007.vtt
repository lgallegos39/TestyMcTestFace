00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.621
Data inaccuracy can be impacted by frontline staff

2
00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:05.695
when inputting information.

3
00:00:05.695 --> 00:00:07.942
If we continue from the previous example,

4
00:00:07.942 --> 00:00:10.224
let's imagine the inventory manager

5
00:00:10.224 --> 00:00:13.292
notices that midlines address was not updated.

6
00:00:13.292 --> 00:00:16.191
To correct this the I.M. went into update

7
00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:18.206
in the item master file.

8
00:00:18.206 --> 00:00:20.716
However, they input the wrong address.

9
00:00:20.716 --> 00:00:23.614
As a result, the information is still incorrect

10
00:00:23.614 --> 00:00:26.149
and is impacted by the frontline staff.

11
00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.441
For this reason it is critical to verify any updates

12
00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:31.251
and information for the vendors,

13
00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:33.869
as well as enter all information accurately.

14
00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:37.205
Lack of data integrity can lead to incorrect quantities

15
00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:40.054
on hand, entries and items on order,

16
00:00:40.054 --> 00:00:42.384
as well as an increase in inventory costs

17
00:00:42.384 --> 00:00:44.541
and long supply that sits on the shelf.

18
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:48.363
Ultimately, it will impact the budget for that area

19
00:00:48.363 --> 00:00:52.376
possibly leading to lack of funds for other important items.
