00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.171
Another way SCM is integral to the success of businesses

2
00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:07.861
is by reducing overall operating costs.

3
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:11.152
A primary way of doing this is by decreasing the purchasing

4
00:00:11.152 --> 00:00:13.341
cost of materials.

5
00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:17.340
Prime Vendors, or PV, employ strategies to quickly deliver

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.364
expensive products and avoid holding costly inventories

7
00:00:21.364 --> 00:00:24.516
in stores any longer than necessary.

8
00:00:24.516 --> 00:00:28.195
For example, Cardinal provides gowns to hospitals across

9
00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:31.624
the country, as a result of the volume and to the bulk

10
00:00:31.624 --> 00:00:35.337
of this item, it is essential that forecasting is accurate,

11
00:00:35.337 --> 00:00:39.247
otherwise skids of gowns will sit in the PV warehouses

12
00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:42.057
and take up valuable real estate that could be used

13
00:00:42.057 --> 00:00:44.794
to house other items, thus creating higher

14
00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:46.794
cost to the PV to store.

15
00:00:47.896 --> 00:00:50.359
In order for supply chains to work effectively

16
00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.748
and efficiently, logistics staff need to decrease

17
00:00:53.748 --> 00:00:56.815
the total cost to manage the supply chain.

18
00:00:56.815 --> 00:01:00.206
By doing this, staff can meet customer expectations

19
00:01:00.206 --> 00:01:03.048
by having the right product in the right amount

20
00:01:03.048 --> 00:01:05.864
on hand when needed for patient care.

21
00:01:05.864 --> 00:01:08.796
Staff can also have the Prime Vendor schedule, plan

22
00:01:08.796 --> 00:01:11.374
and supply needed items to the facility without

23
00:01:11.374 --> 00:01:14.534
overstocking or stock outages.

24
00:01:14.534 --> 00:01:18.189
For example, if real levels are set in the primary

25
00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.068
and secondary areas, then this will impact the true

26
00:01:21.068 --> 00:01:24.180
needs of the facility when you scan and get a list

27
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.209
of items to order from the PV.

28
00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:29.860
As a result, this should cut down on the automated

29
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.952
orders such as ordering the same amount every

30
00:01:32.952 --> 00:01:36.273
week because that is the way it was always done.

31
00:01:36.273 --> 00:01:38.984
The old behavior leads to overstocking,

32
00:01:38.984 --> 00:01:42.134
long supply, and possibly stock outages if the

33
00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:44.651
PV does not have enough to send.
