00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:03.377
Data accuracy is one of the primary factors

2
00:00:03.377 --> 00:00:05.627
that can determine the quality of the data

3
00:00:05.627 --> 00:00:08.020
in your inventory system.

4
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.330
Data accuracy determines whether the data

5
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.609
for an item has correct values,

6
00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.259
such as quantities and pricing.

7
00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.079
For data to be accurate,

8
00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.250
all values must be correctly entered

9
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.939
into the system.

10
00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.358
For example, a shipment of gloves

11
00:00:23.358 --> 00:00:25.978
need to be entered into the VistA system.

12
00:00:25.978 --> 00:00:28.636
The price and quantities need to be accurate

13
00:00:28.636 --> 00:00:30.790
so you know how many gloves you have

14
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.809
and the total inventory dollars tied to that item.

15
00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.238
If this is inaccurate, you may have less

16
00:00:36.238 --> 00:00:39.448
on hand than you need to meet patient care needs.

17
00:00:39.448 --> 00:00:41.918
Or if the dollar value is inaccurate

18
00:00:41.918 --> 00:00:44.664
then it may look like you paid less for the item

19
00:00:44.664 --> 00:00:46.359
which then poses a risk when you need

20
00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.098
to purchase the item again

21
00:00:48.098 --> 00:00:50.495
and expect to pay the incorrect price.
