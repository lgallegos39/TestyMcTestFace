00:00:00.068 --> 00:00:03.441
The nail clippers were a product that was minor in the

2
00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:06.495
procurement process, but a specific item that directly

3
00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:09.131
impacted patient treatment and care.

4
00:00:09.131 --> 00:00:12.896
From the logistics viewpoint, it was important to follow

5
00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:15.712
the correct process to get the item in, standardize

6
00:00:15.712 --> 00:00:19.030
the item, and ensure the correct procurement source.

7
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.190
However, it is important to remember the impact on patient

8
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.427
care and customer service.

9
00:00:24.427 --> 00:00:27.668
The rehab unit was the customer who requested the item to

10
00:00:27.668 --> 00:00:30.054
improve the patient experience.

11
00:00:30.054 --> 00:00:33.426
As a result, it is imperative that the logistics staff

12
00:00:33.426 --> 00:00:36.191
work closely with the customer to meet the needs and the

13
00:00:36.191 --> 00:00:37.852
mission of the agency.
