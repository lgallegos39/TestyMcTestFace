1
00:00:00.984 --> 00:00:02.386
Now that we have accurate data,

2
00:00:02.386 --> 00:00:03.858
what do we do with it?

3
00:00:03.858 --> 00:00:07.439
You should review reports from your inventory system.

4
00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.120
In this instance, it can be from either Vista

5
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.953
or DCEP.

6
00:00:13.255 --> 00:00:15.530
These reports will tell you if you have long supply,

7
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.394
inactive stock, and or increases in usage.

8
00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:22.497
Always confirm reports with a physical inspection

9
00:00:22.497 --> 00:00:24.785
of the storage area, and be sure to talk

10
00:00:24.785 --> 00:00:27.281
to the customer about any findings or questions

11
00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:29.487
you or they may have.

12
00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:32.540
Adjust inventory based on customer response

13
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.802
and your inspection of the storage area,

14
00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:37.950
by either removing, reducing, or increasing

15
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.419
the amount of stock.
