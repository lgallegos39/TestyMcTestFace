00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:02.892
In industry, sales, production,

2
00:00:02.892 --> 00:00:05.755
and after-sales service drive inventory

3
00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:08.688
and inventory management requirements.

4
00:00:08.688 --> 00:00:11.235
In government, mission-based requirements

5
00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:15.148
drive inventory and inventory management requirements.

6
00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:18.031
Both industry and government organizations

7
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:20.964
encounter the need to stock spare parts.

8
00:00:20.964 --> 00:00:23.852
However, the government must forecast and obtain

9
00:00:23.852 --> 00:00:28.104
spares for assets that may have very long lifespans.

10
00:00:28.104 --> 00:00:30.412
While industry does some of this as well,

11
00:00:30.412 --> 00:00:33.824
particularly with automobile and commercial airplane parts,

12
00:00:33.824 --> 00:00:36.370
some companies make the conscious decision

13
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.029
to discontinue spare parts support

14
00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:42.449
to certain end items rather than maintain the inventory.

15
00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.041
This can create difficulty for government.

16
00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:47.432
Sometimes companies replace a spare part

17
00:00:47.432 --> 00:00:50.973
designed for a specific end item with a standard spare part,

18
00:00:50.973 --> 00:00:53.078
such as a motor, for example,

19
00:00:53.078 --> 00:00:55.715
that can support many similar end items.

20
00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:58.767
Sometimes the only option available to the consumer

21
00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:00.907
is to purchase a new item.

22
00:01:00.907 --> 00:01:03.593
An example of inventory management in government

23
00:01:03.593 --> 00:01:06.828
includes logistics hospitals maintaining medical supplies

24
00:01:06.828 --> 00:01:09.166
in the primary storage areas.
