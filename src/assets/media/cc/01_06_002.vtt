00:00:00.443 --> 00:00:03.645
Using performance based logistics strategies,

2
00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:06.131
also known as PBL strategies,

3
00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:08.168
the supply chain is general optimized

4
00:00:08.168 --> 00:00:10.717
for particular item categories.

5
00:00:10.717 --> 00:00:14.884
PBL uses a designated product support integrator, or PSI,

6
00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:18.504
that integrates all sources of support

7
00:00:18.504 --> 00:00:21.437
defined with the scope of PBL agreements

8
00:00:21.437 --> 00:00:24.061
to achieve the documented outcomes.

9
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:27.112
In other words, the supply chain becomes more efficient

10
00:00:27.112 --> 00:00:29.701
and customizable, creating an environment

11
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:31.981
for great customer service.

12
00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:35.269
The concept of tailored customer focused supply chains

13
00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.733
should be a key element of future product support

14
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.316
and PBL strategies.

15
00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:43.235
Remember, customer service drives the supply chains.
