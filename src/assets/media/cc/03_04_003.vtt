00:00:00.555 --> 00:00:02.729
As a logistics employee, your role

2
00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:04.823
is critical to patient care.

3
00:00:04.823 --> 00:00:08.965
Whether you order, distribute, store or manage inventory,

4
00:00:08.965 --> 00:00:12.709
you provide care to patients through clinical staff.

5
00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.273
Having an enterprise system is important because

6
00:00:15.273 --> 00:00:18.156
it gets rid of the silos that can form within departments

7
00:00:18.156 --> 00:00:20.544
or levels or among employees.

8
00:00:20.544 --> 00:00:23.885
When it comes to patient care, silos will only slow down

9
00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:26.333
the communication and the actions needed

10
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.243
to provide the best care to Veterans and their families.

11
00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:32.510
For instance, in the facility, an inventory manager

12
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.746
takes care of the women's clinic.

13
00:00:34.746 --> 00:00:37.865
Over the past month, the inventory manager has noticed

14
00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:41.144
an increase in supplies being used for the area.

15
00:00:41.144 --> 00:00:43.665
After talking to the clinicians in the clinic,

16
00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:46.508
it is discovered that the census for women Veterans

17
00:00:46.508 --> 00:00:48.412
has increased for the facility.

18
00:00:48.412 --> 00:00:52.033
After delivering supplies to the OIF/OEF unit,

19
00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:55.279
and talking to the OEF/OIF coordinator,

20
00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:57.771
it has also been discovered that the facility now

21
00:00:57.771 --> 00:00:59.906
provides child care to Veterans while they

22
00:00:59.906 --> 00:01:01.704
go to their appointments.

23
00:01:01.704 --> 00:01:04.087
As a result, the inventory manager works

24
00:01:04.087 --> 00:01:06.726
with the women's clinic nurse manager and staff

25
00:01:06.726 --> 00:01:09.043
to increase the levels to ensure the unit would

26
00:01:09.043 --> 00:01:11.446
have enough supplies for patient care.

27
00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:14.962
However, if the inventory manager only spoke

28
00:01:14.962 --> 00:01:18.217
with logistic staff and only worked within the silo,

29
00:01:18.217 --> 00:01:20.764
critical information would have been missed.

30
00:01:20.764 --> 00:01:22.673
Levels would not have been increased

31
00:01:22.673 --> 00:01:24.279
to deal with the increase of patients

32
00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:27.072
to the women's clinic, and as a result, the inventory

33
00:01:27.072 --> 00:01:29.189
manager would have had to spend more money

34
00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.885
to overnight the orders.

35
00:01:30.885 --> 00:01:33.654
Or worse, the unit would have had stock outages.

36
00:01:33.654 --> 00:01:35.606
At the end of the day, patient care

37
00:01:35.606 --> 00:01:37.359
would have been greatly impacted.
