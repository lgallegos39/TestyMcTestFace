1
00:00:00.495 --> 00:00:02.097
Supply chains can be exposed

2
00:00:02.097 --> 00:00:03.989
to a lot of risk that can compromise

3
00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:07.745
how logistics staff are able to perform their daily duties.

4
00:00:07.745 --> 00:00:10.642
Some of the risks can include natural disasters,

5
00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:13.283
strikes, and terrorist attacks.

6
00:00:13.283 --> 00:00:15.640
This can happen at the facility level

7
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.214
or up the supply chain,

8
00:00:17.214 --> 00:00:19.029
such as with the Prime Vendor.

9
00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.295
And if and when something like that happens,

10
00:00:21.295 --> 00:00:24.965
it impacts the performance at the hospital level.

11
00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:27.688
For instance, a vendor who makes gloves

12
00:00:27.688 --> 00:00:29.713
is struck by a snow storm.

13
00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:32.390
As a result, they are unable to get supplies

14
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.574
from their site to the hospitals.

15
00:00:34.574 --> 00:00:36.137
The hospitals run out of gloves

16
00:00:36.137 --> 00:00:38.611
because the vendor is unable to deliver them.

17
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:41.419
As a result, this impacts the care of Veterans.

18
00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:44.094
In a competitive advantage situation,

19
00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:47.272
the vendor would have locations in different areas

20
00:00:47.272 --> 00:00:50.241
so the product can be retrieved from another site.

21
00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:53.406
In another example, the hospital would have more than one

22
00:00:53.406 --> 00:00:56.539
vendor in order to have more than one option available.

23
00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.256
As a result, the hospitals would get the supplies

24
00:00:59.256 --> 00:01:02.487
regardless of the disruption in the supply chain.

25
00:01:02.487 --> 00:01:05.624
This would give VA an advantage over other hospitals

26
00:01:05.624 --> 00:01:07.914
that do not practice this method.
