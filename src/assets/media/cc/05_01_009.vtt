00:00:00.495 --> 00:00:03.006
Data aggregation is any process

2
00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:05.512
in which information is gathered and expressed

3
00:00:05.512 --> 00:00:07.030
in a summary form.

4
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.769
For instance, once you scan the ER,

5
00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.159
you will upload your data

6
00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:13.181
and it creates an aggregation list

7
00:00:13.181 --> 00:00:15.048
known as a picking ticket.

8
00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:16.661
This ticket will be a summary

9
00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:18.600
of all the items that you need to deliver.
