00:00:00.412 --> 00:00:02.206
We discussed in an earlier module

2
00:00:02.206 --> 00:00:04.405
how compression is the elimination of levels

3
00:00:04.405 --> 00:00:06.074
in the supply chain.

4
00:00:06.074 --> 00:00:08.932
The private sector has successfully increased service

5
00:00:08.932 --> 00:00:12.140
and decreased costs by using compression.

6
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.421
Initiatives that help accomplish compression

7
00:00:14.421 --> 00:00:17.737
include implementing vendor managed inventory,

8
00:00:17.737 --> 00:00:20.013
substituting cross-docking operations

9
00:00:20.013 --> 00:00:22.491
for traditional warehousing operations,

10
00:00:22.491 --> 00:00:25.226
and contracting for vendors to deliver directly

11
00:00:25.226 --> 00:00:28.959
to customers, also known as Prime Vendor or government.

12
00:00:28.959 --> 00:00:30.893
Another mechanism that is commonly used

13
00:00:30.893 --> 00:00:35.091
for reducing layers in the supply chain are PBL contracts.

14
00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:37.350
These processes are known for speeding the flow

15
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.333
of material and reducing inventory storage.
