00:00:00.251 --> 00:00:03.326
In general, supply chain plays an integral part

2
00:00:03.326 --> 00:00:06.283
in all aspect of the operations.

3
00:00:06.283 --> 00:00:08.703
Each Veteran receives care successfully

4
00:00:08.703 --> 00:00:11.299
because supplies, equipment, or services

5
00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:12.735
are delivered in the right place

6
00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:15.725
at the right time, in the right condition,

7
00:00:15.725 --> 00:00:17.680
and in the right quantity.

8
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.615
Everything we do in supply chain has an impact

9
00:00:20.615 --> 00:00:24.306
on the operation and, ultimately, the Veteran.

10
00:00:24.306 --> 00:00:26.853
So it stands to reason that the organization

11
00:00:26.853 --> 00:00:29.648
cannot operate effectively without a well-managed

12
00:00:29.648 --> 00:00:32.040
and maintained supply chain.

13
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.246
Overseeing and managing these efforts

14
00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:37.202
are the decision makers for each facility.

15
00:00:37.202 --> 00:00:40.561
Let's discuss these roles more specifically.
