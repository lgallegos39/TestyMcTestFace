00:00:00.626 --> 00:00:03.066
Predicting fluctuating demands can make operating

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:06.133
the supply chain very challenging.

3
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:09.748
As the customers' demands changes, the supply chain

4
00:00:09.748 --> 00:00:12.340
must be able to react accordingly.

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.838
For instance, if a new clinic is added to the hospital,

6
00:00:15.838 --> 00:00:18.958
then the overall demand for supplies will increase.

7
00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.858
However, if units in the hospital shut down

8
00:00:21.858 --> 00:00:23.811
for weeks or months, then the need

9
00:00:23.811 --> 00:00:26.014
for these same supplies will decrease.

10
00:00:26.014 --> 00:00:29.447
As a result of the changes in demand, staff can take actions

11
00:00:29.447 --> 00:00:33.718
that impact inventory, whether positive or negative.

12
00:00:33.718 --> 00:00:36.339
Some of these impacts can include holding inventory

13
00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:38.487
to combat uncertainty.

14
00:00:38.487 --> 00:00:41.440
If there is an incident that occurs with the supplier,

15
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.987
there may be uncertainty when an item might be available.

16
00:00:44.987 --> 00:00:48.058
As a result, the logistics staff will order and hold onto

17
00:00:48.058 --> 00:00:50.183
the excessive amounts of supplies

18
00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:52.674
in case there could be stock outages.

19
00:00:52.674 --> 00:00:55.467
There was a time when there were shortages of saline

20
00:00:55.467 --> 00:00:58.296
that is used in the OR and it was difficult to obtain

21
00:00:58.296 --> 00:01:00.048
from any vendors.

22
00:01:00.048 --> 00:01:03.734
As a result, many facilities purchased the saline in bulk,

23
00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:05.894
anticipating that vendors would not have

24
00:01:05.894 --> 00:01:07.826
an adequate supply later.

25
00:01:07.826 --> 00:01:09.621
This prediction came to pass

26
00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:12.644
and saline was difficult to obtain when needed.

27
00:01:12.644 --> 00:01:15.363
The facilities that purchased the saline in bulk in advance

28
00:01:15.363 --> 00:01:18.011
were able to continue with operations.
