1
00:00:00.676 --> 00:00:02.682
Another key performance indicator

2
00:00:02.682 --> 00:00:05.432
is quality control review or QCR.

3
00:00:06.502 --> 00:00:09.087
The QCR team conducts compliance and internal

4
00:00:09.087 --> 00:00:11.834
audit reviews of the department's financial

5
00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:15.490
logistics and capital asset management activities,

6
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.903
primarily at field stations.

7
00:00:17.903 --> 00:00:20.565
The QCR is focused on the conformance aspect

8
00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:24.118
of quality assurance, or in other words, compliance

9
00:00:24.118 --> 00:00:28.272
with VA directives and not total quality of product,

10
00:00:28.272 --> 00:00:30.490
process or service.

11
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.550
The QCR plan outlines the testing methodology

12
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.441
for non expendable item management.

13
00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:38.762
Designated staff will review the management

14
00:00:38.762 --> 00:00:41.653
directives and observe compliance.

15
00:00:41.653 --> 00:00:45.853
The QCR team uses the QCR checklist to ensure facilities

16
00:00:45.853 --> 00:00:48.770
perform daily functions that support the checklist.

17
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.320
To ensure compliance to inventory and equipment

18
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.943
management, which will include training of staff

19
00:00:54.943 --> 00:00:56.973
using reports to manage expendable

20
00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:59.429
and non expendable supplies.

21
00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.240
This is important because there are millions

22
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.192
of dollars tied into expendable and non expendable

23
00:01:04.192 --> 00:01:06.273
supplies at each facility.
