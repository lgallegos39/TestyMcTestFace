00:00:00.357 --> 00:00:02.332
Let's see an example of how demand

2
00:00:02.332 --> 00:00:04.899
is fulfilled by the supply chain.

3
00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:08.531
Frank Ochoa, a Veteran, requires surgery.

4
00:00:08.531 --> 00:00:11.060
This surgery requires 20 items,

5
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.086
ranging from unique items for this specific surgery

6
00:00:14.086 --> 00:00:16.294
to standard hospital items.

7
00:00:16.294 --> 00:00:19.498
These items are sourced from the hospital itself,

8
00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:20.749
from various warehouses

9
00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.139
which are holding additional inventory,

10
00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:25.093
or directly from the vendor.

11
00:00:25.093 --> 00:00:28.457
The vendors in turn receive their parts from various

12
00:00:28.457 --> 00:00:32.427
suppliers located throughout the United States and abroad.

13
00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:35.499
The supply chain ensures that the VA can meet the needs

14
00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:38.507
of Veterans in a timely and cost effective manner.
