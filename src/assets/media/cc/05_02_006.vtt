00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:02.791
The long supply rate is important

2
00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:05.138
because it identifies the percentage of items

3
00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:07.379
that sit in the primary longer

4
00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.830
than the required time to use them.

5
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.865
It may reflect low or no usage as well.

6
00:00:12.865 --> 00:00:15.337
This could be an item that you deliver to a unit

7
00:00:15.337 --> 00:00:16.966
that is not used.

8
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.746
In this case, you would talk to the area staff

9
00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:21.969
to see if it is still needed in the unit.
