1
00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.170
The biggest expense to hospitals is labor,

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.927
or paying for the wages and benefits of staff.

3
00:00:05.927 --> 00:00:08.063
The next biggest expense to hospitals

4
00:00:08.063 --> 00:00:10.301
is the cost of the supply chain,

5
00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:12.950
which could be up to 40% of the budget.

6
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.042
As a result, it is important to manage

7
00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:17.712
the supply chain as much as possible.

8
00:00:17.712 --> 00:00:20.141
Supply chain costs have gone up over time

9
00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:22.844
due to increases in prices of products,

10
00:00:22.844 --> 00:00:27.016
costs to manage supplies, and the costs of labor to track.

11
00:00:27.016 --> 00:00:29.654
The strategic marketplace uses a calculator

12
00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:33.737
to project increasing costs to organizations in healthcare.

13
00:00:33.737 --> 00:00:36.194
According to this calculator, it is predicted

14
00:00:36.194 --> 00:00:40.506
that supply costs will outpace labor costs by 2022.

15
00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:42.546
Logistics staff can make improvements

16
00:00:42.546 --> 00:00:45.271
in their management of their supply chain performance

17
00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:48.352
by managing and improving the purchasing process.

18
00:00:48.352 --> 00:00:51.313
Making such improvements can decrease costs.

19
00:00:51.313 --> 00:00:53.254
According to Gartner Research,

20
00:00:53.254 --> 00:00:55.484
the projections of decreased costs

21
00:00:55.484 --> 00:00:58.556
can be anywhere from 5%-15%.

22
00:00:58.556 --> 00:01:02.047
The same researchers also say that this cost savings

23
00:01:02.047 --> 00:01:03.889
can lead to an increase in profits

24
00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:06.727
anywhere from 2%-7% total.

25
00:01:06.727 --> 00:01:09.173
This approach ultimately leads to the ability

26
00:01:09.173 --> 00:01:11.550
to reallocate funds for patient care

27
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.053
where it can serve our Veterans

28
00:01:13.053 --> 00:01:15.568
and their families in the best possibly way.

29
00:01:15.568 --> 00:01:17.377
The constant push to find ways

30
00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:19.913
of doing things better and more efficiently

31
00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.790
is an endeavor worth taking on.
