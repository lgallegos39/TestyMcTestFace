1
00:00:00.381 --> 00:00:02.867
Customer management provides support to customers

2
00:00:02.867 --> 00:00:05.987
from product inquiry through order completion,

3
00:00:05.987 --> 00:00:08.849
as well as during the post-order period.

4
00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.254
An understanding of customer requirements

5
00:00:11.254 --> 00:00:13.278
flows through the supply chain.

6
00:00:13.278 --> 00:00:16.314
Thus, this information is valuable to warehousing

7
00:00:16.314 --> 00:00:19.112
for item handling, inventory management

8
00:00:19.112 --> 00:00:22.090
for policies, and procurement for restocking.

9
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.269
The improved responsiveness and flexibility that comes

10
00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.617
from information accuracy and visibility ensures

11
00:00:28.617 --> 00:00:31.784
that VA can provide service to all facilities

12
00:00:31.784 --> 00:00:35.042
for patient care and for mobilization efforts.

13
00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:37.333
Understand that mobilization efforts

14
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:40.435
can include emergency management, or EM,

15
00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:43.992
within your facility, which is at the federal level.

16
00:00:43.992 --> 00:00:48.225
EM can be worked at the federal, state, or county level.

17
00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:49.821
Mobilization can also apply

18
00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:52.259
to the pandemic efforts in facilities.
