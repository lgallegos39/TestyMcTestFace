00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:03.580
Every year, each logistics department gets a budget

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.852
for expendable supplies.

3
00:00:05.852 --> 00:00:08.153
Costs associated with the supplies would be

4
00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:11.412
the costs to order, the costs to pay additional shipping

5
00:00:11.412 --> 00:00:13.972
fees for emergent orders, and the costs to manage

6
00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:15.311
the supplies.

7
00:00:15.311 --> 00:00:18.029
If there is robust management of the supply chain

8
00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.700
and all the expendable supplies then the costs

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.775
would decrease.

10
00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:25.522
This is a huge incentive to manage supplies properly.

11
00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:28.250
As what is not spent on additional costs can then be

12
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.191
used for other supplies and to treat patients.

13
00:00:31.191 --> 00:00:34.208
For example, a logistics department for the medical

14
00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:37.042
surgical area gets a budget of 1.5 million

15
00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:38.654
dollars annually.

16
00:00:38.654 --> 00:00:40.730
The money is managed fairly well,

17
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.570
but there is an issue of completing emergency orders

18
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.231
throughout the year, because proper supply levels

19
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:47.307
have not been set.

20
00:00:47.307 --> 00:00:50.972
As a result the costs to complete emergent orders

21
00:00:50.972 --> 00:00:53.369
each year is about 35 thousand dollars.

22
00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:55.953
If the levels were set correctly and managed

23
00:00:55.953 --> 00:00:59.210
by logistics staff, that 35 thousand dollars could

24
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.469
be used to purchase needed items that would not

25
00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.575
otherwise be ordered to improve patient care.
