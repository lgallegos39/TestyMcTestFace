00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.921
A supply chain is an extended enterprise

2
00:00:02.921 --> 00:00:05.517
that crosses boundaries of individual firms

3
00:00:05.517 --> 00:00:09.181
to span the related activities of all the companies involved

4
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:11.215
in the total supply chain.

5
00:00:11.215 --> 00:00:13.952
This extended enterprise should attempt to execute

6
00:00:13.952 --> 00:00:17.165
or implement a coordinated two-way flow of goods

7
00:00:17.165 --> 00:00:22.148
and services, information, and financials, especially cash.

8
00:00:22.148 --> 00:00:25.490
The three flows enumerated below the illustration,

9
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.248
material, information, and financial,

10
00:00:28.248 --> 00:00:29.835
are very important to the success

11
00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:32.337
of supply chain management.

12
00:00:32.337 --> 00:00:35.775
Integration across the boundaries of several organizations,

13
00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:38.121
in essence, means that the supply chain needs

14
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:41.094
to function similar to one organization

15
00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:44.636
in satisfying the ultimate customer, the Veteran.

16
00:00:44.636 --> 00:00:47.771
Let's discuss these three flows more specifically.
