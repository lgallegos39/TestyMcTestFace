00:00:00.407 --> 00:00:01.946
Overstocking, which is defined

2
00:00:01.946 --> 00:00:05.291
as having more goods or supplies than what is needed,

3
00:00:05.291 --> 00:00:07.922
increases the risk of damage, outdating,

4
00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:12.263
contamination, and obsolescence of inventory items.

5
00:00:12.263 --> 00:00:15.163
It also is an inefficient use of financial resources

6
00:00:15.163 --> 00:00:19.334
by purchasing and storing more inventory than is required.

7
00:00:19.334 --> 00:00:21.503
For this reason, end-of-year purchases

8
00:00:21.503 --> 00:00:25.728
which cause overstocking of items, must be avoided.

9
00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:29.043
Understocking creates the risk of unavailability of supplies

10
00:00:29.043 --> 00:00:32.079
which affects the quality of patient care,

11
00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.730
creates additional purchase costs,

12
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.905
such as overnight shipping,

13
00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:39.977
and adversely affects trust users have in SEN staff.

14
00:00:39.977 --> 00:00:42.570
At least quarterly, inventory managers

15
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.252
and functional area employees shall review inventory points

16
00:00:47.252 --> 00:00:50.528
to ensure correct inventory quantities are on hand,

17
00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:54.773
stock properly rotated, no expired product on hand,

18
00:00:54.773 --> 00:00:57.679
and products stored at proper conditions.
