00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:03.714
It goes without saying that an optimized supply chain

2
00:00:03.714 --> 00:00:06.365
has some major benefits, such as creating

3
00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:09.405
a flexible organization that is right-sized in terms of

4
00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:13.535
its logistics footprint, inventory, and setup.

5
00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:15.413
These organizations are responsive

6
00:00:15.413 --> 00:00:20.163
and can adapt to changing market demands or supplier issues.

7
00:00:20.163 --> 00:00:22.486
They have integrated systems where information

8
00:00:22.486 --> 00:00:24.542
flows up and down the supply chain

9
00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:28.343
and supply chain networks are tied together to reduce costs,

10
00:00:28.343 --> 00:00:30.413
creating enabled organizations

11
00:00:30.413 --> 00:00:33.416
where information flows freely.

12
00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:36.482
This all leads to the three v's of supply chain:

13
00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:39.649
visibility, velocity, and variability.
