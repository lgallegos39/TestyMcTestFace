00:00:00.091 --> 00:00:03.668
Due to standardization, all areas would use the same

2
00:00:03.668 --> 00:00:07.493
clippers, the amount to purchase would be the same, and

3
00:00:07.493 --> 00:00:09.201
the price would be the same.

4
00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:13.368
As a result, the monthly amount spent would be $418.20,

5
00:00:14.675 --> 00:00:17.662
and the annual cost would be a significantly lower

6
00:00:17.662 --> 00:00:18.495
$5018.40.

7
00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:24.127
The annual cost savings from getting all of the units

8
00:00:24.127 --> 00:00:27.377
to use the same item would be $7593.60.

00:00:30.258 --> 00:00:33.464
That is only one of the many thousands of line items that

10
00:00:33.464 --> 00:00:34.964
each facility has.
