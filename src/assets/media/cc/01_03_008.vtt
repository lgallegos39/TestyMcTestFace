1
00:00:00.163 --> 00:00:03.378
Organizational variation in transportation can include

2
00:00:03.378 --> 00:00:07.278
networks such as roads, railways, airways, waterways

3
00:00:07.278 --> 00:00:10.071
and pipelines, as well as nodes like airports,

4
00:00:10.071 --> 00:00:12.674
railway stations and seaports.

5
00:00:12.674 --> 00:00:16.012
Transport vehicles like trucks, trains, aircraft

6
00:00:16.012 --> 00:00:19.696
and watercraft come in many varieties as do carriers.

7
00:00:19.696 --> 00:00:22.115
Private, public or military services

8
00:00:22.115 --> 00:00:23.885
they're provided by the truckloads.

9
00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:26.807
Less than truckload by airlift or sealift

10
00:00:26.807 --> 00:00:28.879
and relationships and rates.

11
00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:31.861
Transportation management encounters many variations

12
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:34.442
and challenges because the distribution network

13
00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:38.804
is worldwide and uses road, rail, air and sea.

14
00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:40.968
Transportation management and industry

15
00:00:40.968 --> 00:00:44.197
can be more fully managed by the supply chain.

16
00:00:44.197 --> 00:00:46.791
For instance, Walmart owns it's trucking

17
00:00:46.791 --> 00:00:48.981
and distribution centers to get goods

18
00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:50.966
to their stores for customers.

19
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.608
In the government much of the transportation management

20
00:00:53.608 --> 00:00:55.407
falls on the vendor.

21
00:00:55.407 --> 00:00:57.826
There are no distribution centers in VA

22
00:00:57.826 --> 00:00:59.565
because the vendor stocks the items

23
00:00:59.565 --> 00:01:01.726
in their distribution centers.

24
00:01:01.726 --> 00:01:04.776
As a result, they manage the transportation to get items

25
00:01:04.776 --> 00:01:06.728
into the hospital.

26
00:01:06.728 --> 00:01:09.315
Transportation at VA may include getting items

27
00:01:09.315 --> 00:01:12.238
from the warehouse to the primary storage areas

28
00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.723
and finally to the clinical units.
