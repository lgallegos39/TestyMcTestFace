00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:02.109
The customer creates demand

2
00:00:02.109 --> 00:00:05.252
by requesting equipment or supplies.

3
00:00:05.252 --> 00:00:08.357
Logistics is responsible for the movement of supplies

4
00:00:08.357 --> 00:00:09.837
and equipment from the vendor

5
00:00:09.837 --> 00:00:12.368
right through the delivery to the customer,

6
00:00:12.368 --> 00:00:14.469
or to the distribution points,

7
00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.740
also referred to as secondary areas.

8
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.839
When a need is identified for equipment or supplies,

9
00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.580
a flow of processes takes place.

10
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.037
A process flow is a way to visually represent the connection

11
00:00:27.037 --> 00:00:30.288
of processes of an organization or department.

12
00:00:30.288 --> 00:00:33.065
Many process flows come in the form of flow charts

13
00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:36.536
that will list the steps in that organization's process.

14
00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.450
Let's take a look at some examples

15
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.464
of process flow in the VA.
