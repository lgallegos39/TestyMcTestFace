00:00:00.691 --> 00:00:03.381
This transformation focuses on reinforcing

2
00:00:03.381 --> 00:00:07.153
a strategic orientation to managing two supply types,

3
00:00:07.153 --> 00:00:09.634
non-expendable equipment, or NX,

4
00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:12.753
and expendable supplies, or EX.

5
00:00:12.753 --> 00:00:15.601
It does so by implementing a new operating model

6
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:18.123
that addresses key supply chain topics,

7
00:00:18.123 --> 00:00:22.210
including demand management, inventory management decisions,

8
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.986
delivery design, service, and maintenance.

9
00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:28.607
For NX, the transformation fosters

10
00:00:28.607 --> 00:00:32.134
a strategic national orientation to managing equipment

11
00:00:32.134 --> 00:00:34.345
throughout its serviceable lifespan.

12
00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:38.284
For EX, management and secondary inventory locations

13
00:00:38.284 --> 00:00:41.013
drives improved supply chain performance.
