From the result of expanding markets around the world,

2
00:00:03.289 --> 00:00:06.562
supply chains have grown and continue to change.

3
00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:09.877
As a result, it has become even more important to be

4
00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:12.973
competitive and manage supplies effectively.

5
00:00:12.973 --> 00:00:16.518
To accomplish this, supply chain professionals should have

6
00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:18.734
professional educational training.

7
00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:22.332
Education will help train new staff, update current staff

8
00:00:22.332 --> 00:00:25.409
on changes to the field, and help senior staff maintain

9
00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:29.079
skills to continue to effectively manage inventory.

10
00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.246
The VAAASCM school offers professional courses in supply

11
00:00:34.473 --> 00:00:35.754
chain management.

12
00:00:35.754 --> 00:00:38.187
These developmental courses can help address challenges

13
00:00:38.187 --> 00:00:40.531
of managing a supply chain on a daily basis for

14
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:42.114
supply chain staff.
