00:00:00.365 --> 00:00:04.055
Every organization delivers a service or product.

2
00:00:04.055 --> 00:00:06.733
Supply chain management is vital to supplying

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.336
that service or product in the most effective

4
00:00:09.336 --> 00:00:11.640
and efficient manner possible.

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.383
After all, no one will buy from an unreliable organization

6
00:00:15.383 --> 00:00:18.056
whose product is constantly out of stock

7
00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:20.733
or if they had to wait unreasonable periods of time

8
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.547
to receive a service.

9
00:00:22.547 --> 00:00:25.606
SCM is more than just providing a product.

10
00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:26.737
It includes a way of looking

11
00:00:26.737 --> 00:00:28.884
at how your customers are served

12
00:00:28.884 --> 00:00:30.507
and how to improve that service

13
00:00:30.507 --> 00:00:32.992
at every step of the supply chain.

14
00:00:32.992 --> 00:00:36.611
SCM directly impacts how customers see a company.
