1
00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:03.686
Inventory stockage exists in all supply chains

2
00:00:03.686 --> 00:00:06.896
due to a mismatch between supply and demand.

3
00:00:06.896 --> 00:00:10.016
Mismatches are often intentional, such as the case

4
00:00:10.016 --> 00:00:13.435
when cost-effectiveness dictates batch sizes

5
00:00:13.435 --> 00:00:15.763
or when future demand is unclear

6
00:00:15.763 --> 00:00:18.796
and immediate customer delivery is required.

7
00:00:18.796 --> 00:00:21.828
Inventory also has a significant impact

8
00:00:21.828 --> 00:00:25.027
on the material flow time of the supply chain.

9
00:00:25.027 --> 00:00:27.855
A major conclusion for those who manage inventory

10
00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:31.185
is that decreasing inventory without increasing cost

11
00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:34.739
or decreasing responsiveness to the customer can provide

12
00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.003
a significant flow time advantage in the supply chain.
