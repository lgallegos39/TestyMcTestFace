1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.541
Let's see an example

2
00:00:01.541 --> 00:00:04.551
of how this might work in a VA hospital.

3
00:00:04.551 --> 00:00:07.857
To start, the customer has a need for an item.

4
00:00:07.857 --> 00:00:10.789
He or she is responsible for communicating that need

5
00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:13.478
to the appropriate logistics staff.

6
00:00:13.478 --> 00:00:17.626
This will involve going to the CPRC or equipment meeting,

7
00:00:17.626 --> 00:00:22.070
providing a formal request, usually through the CPRC portal.

8
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.291
He or she will have to know the tentative levels

9
00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:26.692
and provide justification.

10
00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:29.967
In this scenario, the inpatient rehab area

11
00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:33.740
wants to add toenail clippers to the general hygiene care

12
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.104
management for new patients.

13
00:00:36.104 --> 00:00:37.648
The nurse manager estimates

14
00:00:37.648 --> 00:00:40.290
that they get 10 new patients per week,

15
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.898
and because it would be a new item

16
00:00:41.898 --> 00:00:44.679
that has not been supplied to the area before,

17
00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:47.125
a formal request will need to be made.
