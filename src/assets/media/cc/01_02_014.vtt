1
00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:04.658
Strategies used in SCM may differ for different items.

2
00:00:04.658 --> 00:00:08.153
For instance, expendable or commodity type items

3
00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:10.673
that have recurring demand may need a more efficient

4
00:00:10.673 --> 00:00:13.067
supply chain to reduce cost.

5
00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:15.775
An example of this would be ordering gowns.

6
00:00:15.775 --> 00:00:18.010
If you buy a large supply in bulk,

7
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.821
you should get cost savings by the amount that you purchase.

8
00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:25.421
Non-expendable, non-recurring, or customized items

9
00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:28.029
may need a more responsive supply chain.

10
00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.596
An example of this is replacing a CT scan machine.

11
00:00:31.596 --> 00:00:34.057
Due to the specialty and cost of the item,

12
00:00:34.057 --> 00:00:36.462
it may have to be researched and approved

13
00:00:36.462 --> 00:00:39.243
by clinical staff and the equipment committee.

14
00:00:39.243 --> 00:00:42.395
Commodity type items have a more predictable demand

15
00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:44.617
and need an efficient supply chain.

16
00:00:44.617 --> 00:00:47.540
Customized items have a more erratic demand

17
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.931
and need a more responsive supply chain.
