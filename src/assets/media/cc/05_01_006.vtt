00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.577
There are several sources or causes of data inaccuracy.

2
00:00:04.577 --> 00:00:07.195
At first it can be something as simple as entering the

3
00:00:07.195 --> 00:00:10.787
wrong value or making a typo when initially entering data

4
00:00:10.787 --> 00:00:12.113
into the system.

5
00:00:12.113 --> 00:00:15.139
Over time, data values which started out accurately

6
00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.046
can become inaccurate.

7
00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:20.312
For example, let's say a facility uses Medline

8
00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:21.971
for small purchases.

9
00:00:21.971 --> 00:00:24.085
They don't order often from this company,

10
00:00:24.085 --> 00:00:27.858
but with enough frequency to keep them in the vendor file.

11
00:00:27.858 --> 00:00:28.908
After three years,

12
00:00:28.908 --> 00:00:31.874
the vendor has changed their payment address.

13
00:00:31.874 --> 00:00:34.759
If the inventory manager does not update this information

14
00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:37.113
in a timely manner, then there can be delays

15
00:00:37.113 --> 00:00:39.194
in getting payment to Medline.

16
00:00:39.194 --> 00:00:41.683
This damages our relationship with this vendor

17
00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:44.516
and can create a myriad of other problems as well.

18
00:00:44.516 --> 00:00:47.294
Additionally, data movement can be another result

19
00:00:47.294 --> 00:00:48.903
of data inaccuracy.

20
00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:51.373
This can happen when data moves through an unreliable

21
00:00:51.373 --> 00:00:52.940
database system.

22
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.809
For example, if gloves were not properly received

23
00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.951
into the inventory system, it may show that you have

24
00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:02.955
zero on hand, but there are really 50 cases on site.

25
00:01:02.955 --> 00:01:05.841
As a result of this inaccuracy, you will run into

26
00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:08.452
the negative and never really know what quantities

27
00:01:08.452 --> 00:01:10.983
you have on hand without inspecting and adjusting

28
00:01:10.983 --> 00:01:12.150
the inventory.
