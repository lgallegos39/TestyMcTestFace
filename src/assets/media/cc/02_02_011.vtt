00:00:00.556 --> 00:00:02.523
Improved information can come in the form of

2
00:00:02.523 --> 00:00:05.257
accuracy and visibility.

3
00:00:05.257 --> 00:00:07.715
Having improved information, such as accuracy

4
00:00:07.715 --> 00:00:10.512
and visibility, can help logistics staff

5
00:00:10.512 --> 00:00:13.457
plan for restocking of supplies.

6
00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:14.899
Staff will have a better understanding of this

7
00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:16.899
through working with the customers

8
00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:19.758
in understanding their longterm requirements.

9
00:00:19.758 --> 00:00:22.355
Knowing this information can help logistics staff

10
00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.519
plan for restocking of supplies

11
00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.857
and the correct amounts needed.

12
00:00:26.857 --> 00:00:29.357
This also holds true for external suppliers

13
00:00:29.357 --> 00:00:31.059
throughout the supply chain,

14
00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:33.892
such as the Prime Vendor, MSPV-NG.

15
00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:37.961
If facilities within your VISN or region

16
00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:41.798
use large gowns and order a total of 5,000 cases per week,

17
00:00:41.798 --> 00:00:44.601
the Prime Vendor may be able to stock this

18
00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:47.076
at a cheaper price due to bulk purchasing.

19
00:00:47.076 --> 00:00:50.553
As a result, these cost savings may be passed on

20
00:00:50.553 --> 00:00:53.027
to the facilities and the pricing for the item.
