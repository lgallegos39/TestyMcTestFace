00:00:00.265 --> 00:00:02.352
To manage effective supply chains

2
00:00:02.352 --> 00:00:05.388
logistics staff need to balance supplies on hand

3
00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:07.194
with needs of customers.

4
00:00:07.194 --> 00:00:09.305
This involves getting true supply levels

5
00:00:09.305 --> 00:00:12.148
from clinicians to forecast demand.

6
00:00:12.148 --> 00:00:15.453
From here, logistics staff can work with vendors

7
00:00:15.453 --> 00:00:19.304
to accurately forecast orders of supplies.

8
00:00:19.304 --> 00:00:22.454
If the vendor can get a sound forecast on what is needed

9
00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:25.368
in the facility, they can plan their production schedule

10
00:00:25.368 --> 00:00:26.786
in a way where they will be able

11
00:00:26.786 --> 00:00:29.304
to provide the needed supplies.

12
00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:31.876
As a result accurate amounts are ordered,

13
00:00:31.876 --> 00:00:34.787
managed and used for patient care without disruption

14
00:00:34.787 --> 00:00:36.832
through the supply chain.

15
00:00:36.832 --> 00:00:40.120
An example is demonstrated by any increase or decrease

16
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.488
in the amount of supplies needed by the clinicians.

17
00:00:43.488 --> 00:00:46.720
Changes in supplies must be communicated to the vendor

18
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.576
so adjustments can be made to ensure supplies ordered

19
00:00:49.576 --> 00:00:51.493
meet the changed needs.
