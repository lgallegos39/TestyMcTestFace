00:00:00.152 --> 00:00:02.862
Let's look at a few examples of the differences

2
00:00:02.862 --> 00:00:05.590
between goods and services.

3
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.863
Hospitals provide goods to customers, in this case,

4
00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:12.997
patients and staff in the form of medical inventory.

5
00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:16.854
If the hospital has too many sutures in inventory,

6
00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:19.526
this leads to excessive costs tied up in stock

7
00:00:19.526 --> 00:00:21.621
and can also lead to expired stock

8
00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:24.651
if not used in a timely manner.

9
00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:26.306
Another situation could be the staff

10
00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:29.456
not having enough gowns when treating patients.

11
00:00:29.456 --> 00:00:32.250
This can force expensive expedited orders

12
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.630
dissatisfied customers.

13
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.306
Airlines provide services to customers.

14
00:00:37.306 --> 00:00:40.438
If there are too many empty seats on a plane,

15
00:00:40.438 --> 00:00:42.497
that leaves to excessive costs

16
00:00:42.497 --> 00:00:44.310
without the income to support it,

17
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.214
especially with the cost of fuel today.

18
00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:48.552
On the other hand,

19
00:00:48.552 --> 00:00:52.719
overbooking flights leads to lost or dissatisfied customers.
