00:00:00.687 --> 00:00:03.368
Logistics is critical in the supply chain process

2
00:00:03.368 --> 00:00:04.871
at the facility.

3
00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:07.135
Each section of the logistics department

4
00:00:07.135 --> 00:00:09.841
performs a role that impacts the customer.

5
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:11.576
So how does each section of logistics

6
00:00:11.576 --> 00:00:14.061
impact customer service?

7
00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:16.035
Let's start with the warehouse.

8
00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:17.508
We know that this is where equipment

9
00:00:17.508 --> 00:00:19.715
and supplies are processed and transferred

10
00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:22.661
to the requesting user from the supplier.

11
00:00:22.661 --> 00:00:25.156
Some of the work that happens in this process

12
00:00:25.156 --> 00:00:27.893
includes receiving reports, inspecting,

13
00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:30.348
and initiating the payment process.

14
00:00:30.348 --> 00:00:31.940
How does the warehouse play a part

15
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.657
in customer service?

16
00:00:33.657 --> 00:00:35.814
The warehouse is the first line of defense

17
00:00:35.814 --> 00:00:37.513
against anything that can go wrong

18
00:00:37.513 --> 00:00:39.759
in the patient care arena with supply chain.
