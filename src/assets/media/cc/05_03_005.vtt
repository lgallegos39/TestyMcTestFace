1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.680
First, Joe must investigate the situation with the gowns.

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.540
Was there an increase in the use of gowns?

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.811
Would the levels need to be increased to reflect this?

4
00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:13.257
If there was no increase in usage,

5
00:00:13.257 --> 00:00:15.527
could the gowns be placed in a different location,

6
00:00:15.527 --> 00:00:18.544
and need to be placed in the correct location?

7
00:00:18.544 --> 00:00:21.599
In this example, Joe checked all of the above,

8
00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.044
and has verified that there was

9
00:00:23.044 --> 00:00:25.964
an increase in the usage of gowns.

10
00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:28.414
The clinics have hired 10 new staff members

11
00:00:28.414 --> 00:00:30.564
to work in the patient areas.

12
00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:33.314
As a result, Joe has placed an additional order

13
00:00:33.314 --> 00:00:36.574
with his Prime Vendor for the gowns in his depleted stock,

14
00:00:36.574 --> 00:00:40.499
and received them the next day with his Prime Vendor order.

15
00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:44.382
He's also increased his levels to reflect the increase.
