1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.087
Silos can separate different types

2
00:00:02.087 --> 00:00:05.781
of employees, departments or processes.

3
00:00:05.781 --> 00:00:08.322
An organizational silo can be made up of people

4
00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:12.236
in one department, such as fiscal or logistics.

5
00:00:12.236 --> 00:00:15.024
A silo also can extend across departments

6
00:00:15.024 --> 00:00:17.517
to include similar worker types,

7
00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:20.473
such as warehouse staff or purchasing staff.

8
00:00:20.473 --> 00:00:23.584
Silos often separate higher level employees from

9
00:00:23.584 --> 00:00:25.497
front-line workers, such as,

10
00:00:25.497 --> 00:00:28.487
service chiefs or inventory managers.

11
00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:31.072
Silos can also be geographical.

12
00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:32.836
As in the case where workers in different

13
00:00:32.836 --> 00:00:35.459
offices square off against each other.

14
00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:37.328
Which can be seen with some logistics

15
00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:39.629
departments as different VA's.

16
00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.662
Silos form when employees develop more loyalty

17
00:00:42.662 --> 00:00:44.933
to a group than to the employer.

18
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:47.958
As silos solidify, members become more insular

19
00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:51.711
and distrustful of other employees or departments.

20
00:00:51.711 --> 00:00:54.795
Silos usually form due to attempts to optimize

21
00:00:54.795 --> 00:00:58.888
their specific portion of the supply chain to reduce cost.

22
00:00:58.888 --> 00:01:01.402
This can result in the entire supply chain

23
00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:03.676
operating below its potential.

24
00:01:03.676 --> 00:01:06.302
Silos are like fortresses within a company,

25
00:01:06.302 --> 00:01:08.600
and eventually cause serious problems that

26
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.748
might not be noticed until the damage is done.

27
00:01:11.748 --> 00:01:15.500
Organizational silos usually are resistant to change.

28
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.237
Operating to prevent easy access to the information

29
00:01:18.237 --> 00:01:20.165
they hold, and throwing out barriers

30
00:01:20.165 --> 00:01:23.052
to change and cooperation.

31
00:01:23.052 --> 00:01:25.568
Silos make it difficult for communication

32
00:01:25.568 --> 00:01:28.481
and collaboration to occur across units.

33
00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:31.307
Each group works to protect its own interests.
