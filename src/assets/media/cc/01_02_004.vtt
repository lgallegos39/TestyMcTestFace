1
00:00:00.396 --> 00:00:02.979
The focus of the supply chain should always be

2
00:00:02.979 --> 00:00:05.809
on improving quality wherever possible.

3
00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:08.798
Transparency and quality information flow's

4
00:00:08.798 --> 00:00:11.639
the key to making these improvements happen.

5
00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.706
This includes having the right stakeholders

6
00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:15.627
in the decision making process

7
00:00:15.627 --> 00:00:17.427
throughout the whole supply chain,

8
00:00:17.427 --> 00:00:18.791
and one way to ensure this

9
00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:21.468
is by reaching as far back into the supply chain

10
00:00:21.468 --> 00:00:22.989
as possible.

11
00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.417
As information is shared both upstream

12
00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:27.708
and downstream in the supply chain,

13
00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:30.554
partners are able to make well-informed decisions

14
00:00:30.554 --> 00:00:32.780
that in turn can reduce costs,

15
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.572
improve product quality,

16
00:00:34.572 --> 00:00:37.643
and expand overall service across the entire chain.
