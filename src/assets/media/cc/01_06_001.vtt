00:00:00.247 --> 00:00:02.148
In order to be successful,

2
00:00:02.148 --> 00:00:04.142
supply chains must be configured

3
00:00:04.142 --> 00:00:06.986
to individual customer requirements.

4
00:00:06.986 --> 00:00:10.639
The one-size-fits-all supply chain support strategy

5
00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.771
no longer works well in today's technology-driven

6
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:16.211
customer-centric society.

7
00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:18.619
For instance, the support strategy

8
00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.149
and resulting supply chain

9
00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:23.387
for a particular item used by one organization

10
00:00:23.387 --> 00:00:25.519
may be very different from the supply chain

11
00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.020
for the same item used by another organization.

12
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.526
Clearly, supply chains should be tailored

13
00:00:31.526 --> 00:00:33.755
for selected customers through the use of

14
00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:36.886
Prime Vendors, customer-focused teams,

15
00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:39.059
and various product support strategies.
