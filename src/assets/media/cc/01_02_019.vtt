00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:02.757
Compression is a supply chain strategy

2
00:00:02.757 --> 00:00:04.903
that employs the elimination of levels

3
00:00:04.903 --> 00:00:07.249
or echelons in the supply chain.

4
00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:09.374
Large inventories may be reduced

5
00:00:09.374 --> 00:00:11.931
by applying compression initiatives.

6
00:00:11.931 --> 00:00:15.112
The private sector has successfully increased service

7
00:00:15.112 --> 00:00:18.374
and decreased costs by using compression.

8
00:00:18.374 --> 00:00:20.929
Initiatives that help accomplish compression

9
00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:25.297
include implementing vendor-managed inventory or VMI,

10
00:00:25.297 --> 00:00:27.901
substituting cross-docking operations

11
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:30.295
for traditional warehousing operations,

12
00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:31.914
and contracting for vendors

13
00:00:31.914 --> 00:00:34.272
to deliver directly to customers.

14
00:00:34.272 --> 00:00:37.487
This is also known as Prime Vendor in government.

15
00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:40.914
Additionally, PBL contracts are often a mechanism

16
00:00:40.914 --> 00:00:43.577
for reducing layers in the supply chain.

17
00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:46.651
Rather than storing material for later picking,

18
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:50.028
cross-docking operations consolidate incoming shipments

19
00:00:50.028 --> 00:00:53.351
in staging areas for delivery to specific customers.

20
00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:55.662
This process speeds the flow of material

21
00:00:55.662 --> 00:00:57.779
and reduces inventory storage.
