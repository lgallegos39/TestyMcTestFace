00:00:00.396 --> 00:00:03.064
Industry and government share many similarities

2
00:00:03.064 --> 00:00:05.709
in the area of warehousing, with the exception

3
00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:08.344
of the sensitive nature of the items being stored

4
00:00:08.344 --> 00:00:11.399
by the government and the government's special requirements

5
00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:12.787
for packaging.

6
00:00:12.787 --> 00:00:15.485
Additionally, there are special government requirements

7
00:00:15.485 --> 00:00:17.363
for marking, such as barcodes

8
00:00:17.363 --> 00:00:21.024
and radio frequency identification tags, for example,

9
00:00:21.024 --> 00:00:24.011
to enable tracking and asset visibility.

10
00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:26.816
An example of warehousing in government would include

11
00:00:26.816 --> 00:00:29.896
vendors storing items for logistics.

12
00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:32.554
The warehouse serves more as a pass through

13
00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:34.666
in that items are received in the warehouse

14
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.187
and then delivered to the appropriate areas.
