1
00:00:00.587 --> 00:00:02.187
Transportation can vary

2
00:00:02.187 --> 00:00:05.466
greatly between organizations.

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:08.563
There may be variation in network, nodes,

4
00:00:08.563 --> 00:00:11.592
kinds of vehicles, specific carriers,

5
00:00:11.592 --> 00:00:15.924
kinds of services, relationships, and rates.

6
00:00:15.924 --> 00:00:18.431
Regardless of the differences however,

7
00:00:18.431 --> 00:00:20.881
transportation management generally involves

8
00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:23.844
negotiating carrier rates, which may be short

9
00:00:23.844 --> 00:00:26.818
or long-term contracting for shipments,

10
00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:29.223
and establishing partnering relationships,

11
00:00:29.223 --> 00:00:33.352
as well as booking carriers to transport specific shipments.

12
00:00:33.352 --> 00:00:35.800
Loading and unloading the transport vehicles

13
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.817
is part of the process, though they may

14
00:00:37.817 --> 00:00:40.023
be considered warehousing activities

15
00:00:40.023 --> 00:00:42.518
or transportation management activities,

16
00:00:42.518 --> 00:00:45.637
depending on the individual organization.

17
00:00:45.637 --> 00:00:47.776
Transportation management also involves

18
00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:50.302
physically transporting loads from load point

19
00:00:50.302 --> 00:00:52.922
to unload point, while taking port

20
00:00:52.922 --> 00:00:55.652
or airfield operations into account.

21
00:00:55.652 --> 00:00:59.462
And finally, providing transportation systems support,

22
00:00:59.462 --> 00:01:02.511
including document preparation and tracking.
