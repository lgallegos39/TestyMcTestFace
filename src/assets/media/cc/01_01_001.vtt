00:00:00.075 --> 00:00:03.686
Put simply, the supply chain is the flow that begins

2
00:00:03.686 --> 00:00:05.433
with the creation of a product,

3
00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:08.415
and ends with the end user or consumer.

4
00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:12.989
The supply chain is comprised of not only VA's actions,

5
00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:14.725
but the actions of its suppliers

6
00:00:14.725 --> 00:00:17.280
and the supplier’s suppliers,

7
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.108
and can be either a material good

8
00:00:19.108 --> 00:00:22.046
or a service related activity such as medical

9
00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:23.795
or technology support.
