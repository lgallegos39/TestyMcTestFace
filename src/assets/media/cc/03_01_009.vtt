1
00:00:00.372 --> 00:00:04.417
As a result of logistics managing the inventory supply,

2
00:00:04.417 --> 00:00:06.442
there have been fewer missed procedures

3
00:00:06.442 --> 00:00:09.319
due to stock outages or other issues.

4
00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:11.196
An excellent example of this is

5
00:00:11.196 --> 00:00:13.076
the reduction in canceled surgeries

6
00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:14.552
because the supplies were on hand

7
00:00:14.552 --> 00:00:18.510
to perform procedures on patients as originally scheduled.

8
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.977
Another benefit of logistics managing the inventory

9
00:00:21.977 --> 00:00:24.221
is standardizing the types of supplies

10
00:00:24.221 --> 00:00:26.120
and using the Prime Vendor.

11
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.102
Through the use of the Prime Vendor,

12
00:00:28.102 --> 00:00:29.989
facilities can get better pricing

13
00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.467
and quicker access to supplies.

14
00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:35.325
The supplies are also purchased in accordance with policy

15
00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:37.826
and purchased through the proper vendor sources.
