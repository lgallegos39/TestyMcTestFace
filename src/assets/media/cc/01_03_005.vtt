00:00:00.563 --> 00:00:02.500
Warehousing is the physical management

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.774
of items within an organization.

3
00:00:05.774 --> 00:00:08.886
It includes the physical receipt of incoming items,

00:00:08.886 --> 00:00:11.860
the physical storage and control of items,

5
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.545
picking, packing and staging against orders

6
00:00:14.545 --> 00:00:16.964
as well as shipping.

7
00:00:16.964 --> 00:00:19.154
Physical receipt involves accepting items

8
00:00:19.154 --> 00:00:22.303
into the organization, unloading them from inbound

9
00:00:22.303 --> 00:00:25.466
carriers and verifying correct quantities,

10
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.883
qualities, and documentation.

11
00:00:29.407 --> 00:00:31.144
Storage and control of items involves moving

12
00:00:31.144 --> 00:00:34.191
accepted items into the warehouse, putting them away

13
00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:37.183
into correct locations, recording the locations

14
00:00:37.183 --> 00:00:40.180
and amounts into an inventory system, verifying

15
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.370
locations and amounts against inventory system

16
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.112
records and controlling physical access to the items.

17
00:00:47.112 --> 00:00:49.737
Picking, packing and staging involves physically

18
00:00:49.737 --> 00:00:52.640
selecting the correct items and amounts ordered

19
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.926
from the warehouse, decrementing the inventory records,

20
00:00:55.926 --> 00:00:58.866
placing the items into appropriate containers,

21
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.784
labeling the containers as required and moving the

22
00:01:01.784 --> 00:01:06.066
containers into an area to building shipping loads.

23
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.304
Shipping involves loading outbound carriers with

24
00:01:08.304 --> 00:01:10.460
packed borders and completing and providing

25
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.859
associated documentation such as bills of loading.

26
00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:18.080
An example of warehousing and industry would include

27
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.526
storing items for Walmart.

28
00:01:20.526 --> 00:01:23.345
For instance, Walmart has distribution centers

29
00:01:23.345 --> 00:01:25.758
that will store items until requested by the

30
00:01:25.758 --> 00:01:27.175
