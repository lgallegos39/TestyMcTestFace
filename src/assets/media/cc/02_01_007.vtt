00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.803
Let's start with a better understanding of demand.

2
00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:06.544
Demand is a request from the customer.

3
00:00:06.544 --> 00:00:10.043
This request can be for either an item or a service,

4
00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:12.813
such as expendable or nonexpendable items

5
00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:14.651
or equipment replacement.

6
00:00:14.651 --> 00:00:17.333
In the supply chain, demand is often expressed

7
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.831
in terms of items per time period,

8
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:22.472
such as the ICU will have a weekly usage

9
00:00:22.472 --> 00:00:26.683
of 100 large gowns or about 400 large gowns per month

10
00:00:26.683 --> 00:00:28.224
for patients' use.

11
00:00:28.224 --> 00:00:30.952
Demand could be either eternal or external,

12
00:00:30.952 --> 00:00:33.613
such as customers from other VA organizations

13
00:00:33.613 --> 00:00:34.946
or a VA patient.
