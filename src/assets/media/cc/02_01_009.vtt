00:00:00.696 --> 00:00:03.226
Probably the most important thing to remember

2
00:00:03.226 --> 00:00:05.889
about demand is that it can change.

3
00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:08.129
Many factors influence demand,

4
00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.448
such as patient fluctuation, which is also referred to

5
00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:14.617
as inherent variability. Seasonality,

6
00:00:14.617 --> 00:00:17.559
such as flu season, means an increased demand

7
00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.076
for flu shots.

8
00:00:19.076 --> 00:00:21.704
Changes in customer preference, technology,

9
00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:23.328
and government regulations

10
00:00:23.328 --> 00:00:25.344
can all have an effect as well.

11
00:00:25.344 --> 00:00:28.379
The competitiveness of the market plays a part too.
