1
00:00:00.207 --> 00:00:03.549
The cost center will be the cost center associated

2
00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:05.718
with the requesting service.

3
00:00:05.718 --> 00:00:08.968
In this example, 822 300 is laboratory.

4
00:00:10.626 --> 00:00:12.836
At this point, you will pull up the vendor

5
00:00:12.836 --> 00:00:14.568
that you want to order from.

6
00:00:14.568 --> 00:00:17.617
Once that is set, then you will put in the line items

7
00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:20.638
for the order, starting sequentially with one.

8
00:00:20.638 --> 00:00:23.720
It will then prompt you to put in the item master file,

9
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.197
or IMF number.

10
00:00:25.197 --> 00:00:28.256
Once you put in the IMF, you get the description

11
00:00:28.256 --> 00:00:29.390
of the item.

12
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.347
If it matches what you were ordering,

13
00:00:31.347 --> 00:00:34.243
you will accept and go forward with the order.

14
00:00:34.243 --> 00:00:36.823
As a note, when asked if you would like to see

15
00:00:36.823 --> 00:00:39.945
the procurement history, it is best to say yes.

16
00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:42.646
This will give you opportunity to see when you have

17
00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:45.004
previously purchased, and the quantities,

18
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:47.939
to get an idea of what you will need for the current order.

19
00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:50.103
In this example, we say no.
