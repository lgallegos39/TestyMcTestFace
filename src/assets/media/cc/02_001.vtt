Welcome to module two,

00:00:01.813 --> 00:00:04.317
How SCM Supports the Mission.

3
00:00:04.317 --> 00:00:05.495
In this module,

4
00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:08.208
we will be discussing where supply chain management

5
00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:11.205
fits into the overall supply chain process,

6
00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:13.316
as well as how important logistics are

7
00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:16.387
to supporting our Veterans and their families.

8
00:00:16.387 --> 00:00:18.836
Additionally, you will come to understand

9
00:00:18.836 --> 00:00:20.643
your value proposition

10
00:00:20.643 --> 00:00:22.219
under the mission and message

11
00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:25.492
that VA strives to support every day.

12
00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:27.082
Finally, we will review

13
00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:29.651
our customer service goals and commitment.
