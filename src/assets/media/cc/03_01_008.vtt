00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:02.509
In the past, clinicians managed

2
00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:05.447
their own expendable inventory.

3
00:00:05.447 --> 00:00:08.192
In other words, they purchased, received,

4
00:00:08.192 --> 00:00:12.071
put away, stored, and managed supplies.

5
00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:15.301
This took precious time away from their main priority:

6
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:17.551
to focus on patient care.

7
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:20.421
As a result, supplies were overstocked,

8
00:00:20.421 --> 00:00:22.017
funds ran out quickly,

9
00:00:22.017 --> 00:00:24.383
supplies expired from not being used,

10
00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:27.086
and most importantly, time was taken away

11
00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:30.850
from the patient to focus on an administrative duty.

12
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.730
When this issue was identified,

13
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.263
logistics took over the support and management

14
00:00:35.263 --> 00:00:37.653
of the supply chain duties so that the clinicians'

15
00:00:37.653 --> 00:00:40.100
focus could return to the patient.

16
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.266
Logistics communicates with clinicians

17
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.764
to gauge needs and address any changes

18
00:00:44.764 --> 00:00:47.214
so as not to interrupt patient care.

19
00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:50.034
As a result, clinicians can focus on patients

20
00:00:50.034 --> 00:00:51.790
and know that they will get what they need

21
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:52.867
when they need it.
