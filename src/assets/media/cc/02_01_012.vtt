00:00:00.291 --> 00:00:03.466
When your supply levels exceed the demand of the customer,

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.889
you will have a surplus of supplies.

3
00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:07.961
Surplus can mean you will have money

4
00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:11.471
tied into supplies purchased that are not needed or used.

5
00:00:11.471 --> 00:00:14.890
As a result, you will have long supply in inactive stock

6
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.279
in the facility.

7
00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.303
This could result in budgetary issues and being unable

8
00:00:19.303 --> 00:00:21.206
to buy stock you need.

9
00:00:21.206 --> 00:00:22.562
An example here again

10
00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:25.060
could be gowns used in the women's clinic.

11
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.972
Say the demand for the women's clinic has changed,

12
00:00:27.972 --> 00:00:29.678
but this time there has been a decrease

13
00:00:29.678 --> 00:00:32.310
in the women Veterans coming to the facility.

14
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.140
As a result, demand for gowns has decreased

15
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.709
from 100 gowns per week to 50 gowns per week.

16
00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:40.945
The logistic staff has not been informed of this

17
00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:44.503
and continues to supply 100 gowns per week.

18
00:00:44.503 --> 00:00:47.236
In this example, the current amount of supply

19
00:00:47.236 --> 00:00:49.965
exceeds the amount to meet demand needed

20
00:00:49.965 --> 00:00:52.037
for the area that you supply.

21
00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:54.374
Due to the change in demand, the women's clinic

22
00:00:54.374 --> 00:00:57.255
has more than the amount needed to provide to patients

23
00:00:57.255 --> 00:00:59.500
double the amount needed.

24
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.354
As a result, the needs of the patients per week

25
00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:05.111
will be met but 50% of the amount of gowns

26
00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:07.422
will sit in the area not being used.

27
00:01:07.422 --> 00:01:10.002
These gowns could have been used in another clinic.

28
00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:13.922
As a consequence, it may cause a shortage in another area

29
00:01:13.922 --> 00:01:16.592
unless the amount of gowns supplied is decreased

30
00:01:16.592 --> 00:01:18.323
to accurately meet the demand.
