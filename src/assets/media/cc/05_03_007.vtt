1
00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:03.146
Next, Joe must investigate the situation

2
00:00:03.146 --> 00:00:04.937
with the slipper socks.

3
00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:07.164
Was the order placed incorrectly?

4
00:00:07.164 --> 00:00:10.370
Did the vendor indeed send the incorrect item?

5
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.896
What actions can be done next?

6
00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:15.731
In this example, Joe has checked all of the above,

7
00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:19.796
and has verified that he placed the order correctly,

8
00:00:19.796 --> 00:00:22.548
but the vendor indeed sent the wrong items.

9
00:00:22.548 --> 00:00:26.306
As a result, it will create a need for the slipper socks.

10
00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:29.102
Joe has contacted the vendor to notify them

11
00:00:29.102 --> 00:00:32.686
of the incorrect items and requested that they are returned.

12
00:00:32.686 --> 00:00:35.350
He then requested that the vendor send the items

13
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.743
that were originally ordered as soon as possible

14
00:00:37.743 --> 00:00:39.977
due to the demand requirements.

15
00:00:39.977 --> 00:00:42.423
Joe has stayed in contact with the vendor

16
00:00:42.423 --> 00:00:44.925
throughout the process to include tracking the item

17
00:00:44.925 --> 00:00:47.603
until it was delivered to the facility.

18
00:00:47.603 --> 00:00:50.265
Once the correct item came in the next day

19
00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:52.133
with the Prime Vendor order, Joe insured that they

20
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:55.130
were properly received into the inventory system

21
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.548
and distributed to the needed areas.
