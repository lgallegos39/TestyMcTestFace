00:00:00.323 --> 00:00:02.022
If there is an increase in usage

2
00:00:02.022 --> 00:00:04.752
that has not been communicated to staff,

3
00:00:04.752 --> 00:00:07.863
they may not provide enough supplies to the area.

4
00:00:07.863 --> 00:00:10.843
For instance, if a unit has increased their use

5
00:00:10.843 --> 00:00:13.462
of large adult diapers but this is not noticed

6
00:00:13.462 --> 00:00:16.173
by the supply staff, then the unit may end up

7
00:00:16.173 --> 00:00:19.192
with less of the items than they desperately need.

8
00:00:19.192 --> 00:00:20.894
The important thing to remember

9
00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:23.712
is that SCM helps to balance the trade-offs

10
00:00:23.712 --> 00:00:27.131
of fulfilling customer demands as efficiently as possible.
