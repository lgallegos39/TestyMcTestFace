00:00:00.687 --> 00:00:02.506
Yet another report that can be viewed

2
00:00:02.506 --> 00:00:04.409
from the main screen would be the

3
00:00:04.409 --> 00:00:07.713
items with no costs that are greater than zero,

4
00:00:07.713 --> 00:00:10.330
but there are no items on hand.

5
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.310
This report will give you a summary

6
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.881
of all the items in the primary area selected.

7
00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:20.061
For this example, we have selected the main search primary.

8
00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:22.352
It will list the total number of items,

9
00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:24.670
the total amount of compliant items,

10
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.933
and the total amount of noncompliant items.

11
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.642
The noncompliant items will be items that have no

12
00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:34.949
quantities but an associated cost tied to the items.

13
00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:36.890
These items can be further drilled down

14
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.761
and then corrected by authorized staff.

15
00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:41.699
Just select the number itself

16
00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.834
to get the detailed information.
