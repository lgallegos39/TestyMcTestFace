00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:03.916
As information is shared upstream and downstream,

2
00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:05.504
supply chain partners are able

3
00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:07.883
to make well-informed decisions.

4
00:00:07.883 --> 00:00:10.113
The results of these good decisions include

5
00:00:10.113 --> 00:00:12.713
reducing cost, improving quality,

6
00:00:12.713 --> 00:00:16.247
and having the flexibility to improve the overall service

7
00:00:16.247 --> 00:00:18.390
across the entire supply chain.

8
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.834
The supply chain's focus should always be

9
00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:23.656
on improving quality wherever possible.

10
00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:25.923
This includes having the right stakeholders

11
00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:27.638
in the decision making process

12
00:00:27.638 --> 00:00:30.201
to help throughout the entire supply chain.

13
00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:32.232
This should be done by reaching as far back

14
00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.374
into the supply chain as possible.

15
00:00:34.374 --> 00:00:36.713
One example would be how the facility

16
00:00:36.713 --> 00:00:40.165
can work with the prime vendor to repackage items.

17
00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:42.454
Let's say a facility orders an item

18
00:00:42.454 --> 00:00:44.623
that may come in a high unit of measure,

19
00:00:44.623 --> 00:00:46.242
such as by the case.

20
00:00:46.242 --> 00:00:48.328
If an entire case is not needed

21
00:00:48.328 --> 00:00:50.522
and there is limited space to store the item

22
00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:52.474
in the primary storage area,

23
00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:55.719
the facility may request the item be repackaged

24
00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.466
from the Prime Vendor.

25
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.543
By taking such an action,

26
00:00:59.543 --> 00:01:01.671
this will allow the breakdown of the item

27
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:03.872
to go from a higher unit of measure,

28
00:01:03.872 --> 00:01:06.947
such as a case, to a lower unit of measure,

29
00:01:06.947 --> 00:01:10.268
as in by a box or each individual item.

30
00:01:10.268 --> 00:01:13.258
As a result, the facility will receive the item

31
00:01:13.258 --> 00:01:16.398
in the quantities needed to deliver patient care

32
00:01:16.398 --> 00:01:19.528
without overstocking or taking valuable shelf space

33
00:01:19.528 --> 00:01:22.308
away from other needed clinical items.

34
00:01:22.308 --> 00:01:25.273
Working as far back in the supply chain as possible

35
00:01:25.273 --> 00:01:28.369
is also beneficial when applied to equipment.

36
00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.219
An example of this would be to take

37
00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:34.824
a commercial off the shelf, or COTS, equipment item

38
00:01:34.824 --> 00:01:38.034
and customize it to meet the specific needs of the VA

39
00:01:38.034 --> 00:01:40.887
when a government off the shelf, or GOTS,

40
00:01:40.887 --> 00:01:42.713
item is not available.

41
00:01:42.713 --> 00:01:46.222
This could also create an opportunity to remove or reduce

42
00:01:46.222 --> 00:01:48.201
some of the functions of the equipment

43
00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:50.551
if they are not needed for performance.
