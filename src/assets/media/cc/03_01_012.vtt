00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.833
An organizational chart is a diagram

2
00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:04.927
that shows the structure of a department

3
00:00:04.927 --> 00:00:07.012
within the organization.

4
00:00:07.012 --> 00:00:09.869
It also shows the relationships in relative ranks

5
00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:12.841
of its positions within the department.

6
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:15.227
Organizational charts can be a great tool

7
00:00:15.227 --> 00:00:17.062
to assist employees and managers

8
00:00:17.062 --> 00:00:20.008
in improving their performance of daily duties.

9
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:21.673
They also serve to show management

10
00:00:21.673 --> 00:00:25.104
and staff clear promotional channels to navigate.

11
00:00:25.104 --> 00:00:28.166
Organizational charts can offer many other benefits

12
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.850
to the organization and its staff.

13
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.682
Some of these other benefits include helping employees

14
00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:37.316
know their roles in their jobs and their rights.

15
00:00:37.316 --> 00:00:39.943
Org charts help management balance the workload

16
00:00:39.943 --> 00:00:43.443
of staff evenly among all employees and helps them

17
00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:46.725
analyze and plan their budgets based on workloads.

18
00:00:46.725 --> 00:00:49.845
They enable other departments to understand the structure

19
00:00:49.845 --> 00:00:52.582
of the department and how it impacts their department

20
00:00:52.582 --> 00:00:54.425
and the whole organization,

21
00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:57.412
as well as helping to provide department structure

22
00:00:57.412 --> 00:01:01.331
so everyone can understand how to meet facility goals.

23
00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:06.230

24
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.397
