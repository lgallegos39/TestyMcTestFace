1
00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.111
The Veterans Affairs Acquisition Academy, or VAAA,

2
00:00:05.111 --> 00:00:06.976
was created to address the growing

3
00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:09.266
supply chain workforce challenge

4
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:12.458
facing the Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA,

5
00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:14.785
and the federal government overall.

6
00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:17.310
With the loss of institutional knowledge resulting

7
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.481
from baby boomer retirements,

8
00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:21.857
the supply chain workforce has been strained

9
00:00:21.857 --> 00:00:25.118
to keep pace with the increased complexities associated

10
00:00:25.118 --> 00:00:27.337
with supporting the VA mission.

11
00:00:27.337 --> 00:00:30.463
Additionally, oversight of the supply chain function

12
00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:33.608
across the entire federal government has grown dramatically

13
00:00:33.608 --> 00:00:35.023
in recent years.

14
00:00:35.023 --> 00:00:37.594
The level of the educational degree will determine

15
00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:40.712
the qualifications for the higher level positions.

16
00:00:40.712 --> 00:00:43.221
As the supply chain becomes competitive,

17
00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:45.110
it is imperative to have the staff

18
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.774
that can meet the challenges.

19
00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:50.153
Higher levels of education will assist with this goal.

20
00:00:50.153 --> 00:00:52.723
A master's degree is looked upon favorably

21
00:00:52.723 --> 00:00:56.160
and can lead to greater opportunities within SCM.

22
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.805
However, if employees have a bachelor's degree

23
00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:01.195
with a significant level of experience,

24
00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:03.661
then they may qualify for the position as well.
