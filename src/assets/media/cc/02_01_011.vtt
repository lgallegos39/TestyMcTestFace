1
00:00:00.387 --> 00:00:03.918
When your demand exceeds the supply you have on hand,

2
00:00:03.918 --> 00:00:06.089
you will run into a shortage.

3
00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.244
Shortages will result in the unavailability of supplies

4
00:00:09.244 --> 00:00:11.919
for the clinical staff to treat patients.

5
00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:13.915
This could result in stock outages

6
00:00:13.915 --> 00:00:17.470
and additional costs to overnight the items needed.

7
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.791
An example would be gowns used in the women's clinic.

8
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:24.006
Say the demand for the women's clinic has changed.

9
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:27.092
More women Veterans have been coming to the facility.

10
00:00:27.092 --> 00:00:29.708
As a result, demand for gowns has increased

11
00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:33.498
from 100 gowns per week to 150 gowns per week.

12
00:00:33.498 --> 00:00:36.068
The logistics staff has not been informed of this

13
00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:39.305
and continues to supply 100 gowns per week.

14
00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.852
In this example, the current amount of supply

15
00:00:41.852 --> 00:00:45.695
does not meet demand needed for the area that you supply.

16
00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:47.315
Due to the change in demand,

17
00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:49.767
the women's clinic has less than the amount needed

18
00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:51.433
to provide to patients.

19
00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:54.296
As a result, the needs of the patients per week

20
00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:55.973
will not be met unless the amount

21
00:00:55.973 --> 00:00:58.643
of gowns supplied is increased to meet the demand.
