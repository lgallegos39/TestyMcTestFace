00:00:00.384 --> 00:00:04.418
A supply chain is also a system of organizations, people,

2
00:00:04.418 --> 00:00:07.736
activities, information and resources

3
00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:10.461
that are involved in the movement of a good or service

4
00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:13.764
from the supplier or point of origin to the customer

5
00:00:13.764 --> 00:00:15.775
or point of consumption.

6
00:00:15.775 --> 00:00:19.180
Supply chains can range from very simple to complex.

7
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.220
Starting with as few as three companies,

8
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.500
to involving dozens of organizations

9
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.996
spread across numerous stages

10
00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:27.908
of supplier and distributor tiers.

11
00:00:27.908 --> 00:00:31.056
A single company may be part of multiple supply chains

12
00:00:31.056 --> 00:00:34.988
if the company handles several different product categories.

13
00:00:34.988 --> 00:00:38.048
Two companies participating in multiple supply chains

14
00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:40.507
may have very different relationships with each other

15
00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:41.976
in each chain.

16
00:00:41.976 --> 00:00:45.592
In one instance, they may be customer and supplier,

17
00:00:45.592 --> 00:00:48.739
while in another chain, the roles may be reversed.

18
00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.516
In yet another case, they may be close collaborators

19
00:00:51.516 --> 00:00:55.191
in one supply chain and fierce competitors in other chains

20
00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:56.147
at the same time.
