00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:02.378
It is well known that Supply Chain Management

2
00:00:02.378 --> 00:00:05.277
is an integral part of most businesses,

3
00:00:05.277 --> 00:00:07.055
and is essential to company success

4
00:00:07.055 --> 00:00:09.341
and customer satisfaction.

5
00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:12.014
It is a fact that good supply chain management

6
00:00:12.014 --> 00:00:13.636
boosts customer service.

7
00:00:13.636 --> 00:00:16.483
Customers expect the correct product assortment

8
00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:19.341
and quantity to be delivered throughout the hospital

9
00:00:19.341 --> 00:00:22.701
and are available at the right location.

10
00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:26.061
For example, customer satisfaction can diminish

11
00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:29.017
in the inpatient units if the logistics department

12
00:00:29.017 --> 00:00:32.019
does not have the necessary clinical items

13
00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:34.040
to treat patients.

14
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.360
Continuously running out of gowns or gloves

15
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.176
can have a serious negative impact on patient care.

16
00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:43.199
Most importantly, customers expect products

17
00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.080
to be delivered on time.

18
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.483
For example, if there is a surgery scheduled for Friday

19
00:00:48.483 --> 00:00:50.920
on a patient in the OR.

20
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.800
The staff expects the items required for the surgery

21
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.001
to be there prior to the case,

22
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:57.731
and not a day after the fact.
