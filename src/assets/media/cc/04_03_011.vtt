1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.390
The items for the rehab secondary room are scanned

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.242
by the supply technician, or IM, as appropriate.

3
00:00:07.242 --> 00:00:08.998
Scanning is when you use a scanner

4
00:00:08.998 --> 00:00:11.570
or a gun to digitally scan a label.

5
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.392
This is done to get a count of the items

6
00:00:13.392 --> 00:00:16.529
in the distribution, or secondary, area.

7
00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.354
Once you scan, you input the counts on hand

8
00:00:19.354 --> 00:00:22.155
and this will update in the inventory file.

9
00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.840
It will also let you know if your levels are low

10
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.469
and generate a picking ticket

11
00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:28.851
once the scanning data is uploaded.

12
00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:30.523
Scanning is done daily.

13
00:00:30.523 --> 00:00:33.144
The responsible staff will go to the primary

14
00:00:33.144 --> 00:00:35.043
and see the items are in.

15
00:00:35.043 --> 00:00:38.780
The IMST will pull the clippers for the rehab area

16
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.560
and the customers get the clippers,

17
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.160
and the requirement has been met.

18
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.172
The IM and the NM will monitor the usage of the item

19
00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:50.713
over time to determine if the levels need be changed.

20
00:00:50.713 --> 00:00:54.283
This may take at least 30 days to determine the true needs.
