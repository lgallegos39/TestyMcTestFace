1
00:00:00.794 --> 00:00:04.800
Next, Joe must investigate the situation with the gloves.

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.775
Was there a decrease in the use of gloves?

3
00:00:07.775 --> 00:00:11.002
Would the levels need to be decreased to reflect this?

4
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:13.276
Can the overstocked items be excessed

5
00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:15.159
if they will not be used?

6
00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:17.493
Are areas pending a delivery of the gloves

7
00:00:17.493 --> 00:00:19.580
and have not received them?

8
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.966
In this example, Joe has checked all of the above

9
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.905
and has verified that there was a decrease

10
00:00:24.905 --> 00:00:26.834
in the amount of gloves used

11
00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:29.978
due to a clinic being closed over the weekend.

12
00:00:29.978 --> 00:00:34.292
As a result, it created a temporary surplus of the supplies.

13
00:00:34.292 --> 00:00:36.020
After further investigation,

14
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.122
checking the usage demand,

15
00:00:38.122 --> 00:00:40.813
Joe has found that the gloves will be used very quickly,

16
00:00:40.813 --> 00:00:43.102
and he has decided not to excess.
