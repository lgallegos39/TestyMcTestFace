1
00:00:00.643 --> 00:00:03.443
The facility logistics staff work with customers

2
00:00:03.443 --> 00:00:05.763
to forecast demand and gain an understanding

3
00:00:05.763 --> 00:00:07.603
of their needs.

4
00:00:07.603 --> 00:00:10.021
This helps establish automated inventories

5
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:12.925
through use of generic inventory programs,

6
00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:17.384
also known as GIP, or its successor program.

7
00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.981
The logistics staff would monitor stock replenishment,

8
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:22.920
monitor supply and commodity consumption,

9
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.208
and analyze usage and cost reports

10
00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:28.581
to advise customer, fiscal, and facility or

11
00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:29.787
VISN leadership.

12
00:00:29.787 --> 00:00:33.334
The ultimate goal is to provide uninterrupted service

13
00:00:33.334 --> 00:00:37.257
to customers at the lowest possible total ownership cost.

14
00:00:37.257 --> 00:00:39.852
Logistics needs to continually assess

15
00:00:39.852 --> 00:00:42.255
inventories and adjust stock levels

16
00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:44.359
to maintain the desired balance.

17
00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.755
For example, unit 34 will request surgical boots

18
00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:51.064
for a patient that has been moved to the area

19
00:00:51.064 --> 00:00:53.800
from the ICU after surgery.

20
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.227
This request falls into the customer demand category.
