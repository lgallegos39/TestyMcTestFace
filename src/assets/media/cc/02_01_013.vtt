00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:03.549
As we discussed in the first module of this course,

2
00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:06.394
the two primary elements of the VA supply chain

3
00:00:06.394 --> 00:00:09.731
are the goods and services provided to its customers.

4
00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:12.308
Remember that many times these goods or services

5
00:00:12.308 --> 00:00:14.849
are aiding our own internal VA customers,

6
00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.679
and not external customers.

7
00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:21.129
Goods can be stored in inventory, which can be an issue.

8
00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:23.961
Too much inventory leads to excessive costs,

9
00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:25.444
while insufficient inventory

10
00:00:25.444 --> 00:00:29.531
leads to expedited orders and dissatisfied customers.

11
00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:31.846
Examples of excessive costs include

12
00:00:31.846 --> 00:00:35.413
the costs to purchase the items, storage of the item,

13
00:00:35.413 --> 00:00:38.685
and of staff to manage the inventory process.

14
00:00:38.685 --> 00:00:40.056
If you are on a budget

15
00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:43.484
but spend money to purchase items that are not used readily,

16
00:00:43.484 --> 00:00:45.349
then you limit what else you can purchase

17
00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:46.670
because the money is tied up

18
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.802
into what was spent on the excess inventory.

19
00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:53.016
If you have limited storage space in your inventory areas

20
00:00:53.016 --> 00:00:55.197
and you have excess amounts of an item,

21
00:00:55.197 --> 00:00:56.886
this will take up valuable space

22
00:00:56.886 --> 00:00:59.528
that could be used for other items needed.

23
00:00:59.528 --> 00:01:00.642
Staff would have been used

24
00:01:00.642 --> 00:01:03.573
to purchase these items, receive items in,

25
00:01:03.573 --> 00:01:06.696
transport to the storage area, and monitor.

26
00:01:06.696 --> 00:01:09.218
If there is an excess that is not used,

27
00:01:09.218 --> 00:01:11.938
that excess will sit in the primary storage area

28
00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:14.368
and will have to be checked for expirations,

29
00:01:14.368 --> 00:01:16.229
rotated, and counted.

30
00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.270
This takes time and resources to complete.

31
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.261
On the other hand, having insufficient inventory

32
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:24.707
leads to excessive costs.

33
00:01:24.707 --> 00:01:26.338
Orders have to be expedited,

34
00:01:26.338 --> 00:01:29.453
and as a result the costs of the items increase,

35
00:01:29.453 --> 00:01:31.469
and there could also be additional shipping

36
00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.742
or freight charges incurred.

37
00:01:33.742 --> 00:01:36.935
If this happens during weekends or off hours

38
00:01:36.935 --> 00:01:38.731
then staff would be paid overtime

39
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.056
to be on site to receive and deliver the items

40
00:01:41.056 --> 00:01:43.818
to the clinical staff for patient care.

41
00:01:43.818 --> 00:01:47.005
If the items are not received in time, or at all,

42
00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:49.718
then patient care cases, such as surgeries,

43
00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:52.465
can be canceled, or even higher costs are incurred

44
00:01:52.465 --> 00:01:54.747
rescheduling the procedures.

45
00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:58.070
The biggest costs are having dissatisfied customers,

46
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.049
faith lost by clinical staff,

47
00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.866
and the loss of patients to the hospital.

48
00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:07.175
The need for equilibrium or balance is very important.

49
00:02:07.175 --> 00:02:11.271
Services, on the other hand, cannot be stored in inventory.

50
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:14.873
For instance, medical staff provide services to patients

51
00:02:14.873 --> 00:02:17.352
in the form of medical care and support.

52
00:02:17.352 --> 00:02:19.329
The number of staff members available,

53
00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.058
such as doctors and nurses, directly affects

54
00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:24.622
the number of patients that can be cared for.

55
00:02:24.622 --> 00:02:26.820
If too many staff members are scheduled,

56
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.497
there are excessive costs in salary and time

57
00:02:29.497 --> 00:02:31.665
and much lower productivity.

58
00:02:31.665 --> 00:02:33.366
If too few are scheduled,

59
00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:36.042
patients cannot be cared for in a timely manner,

60
00:02:36.042 --> 00:02:38.418
leading to canceled appointments or surgeries

61
00:02:38.418 --> 00:02:40.883
and lost or dissatisfied customers.
