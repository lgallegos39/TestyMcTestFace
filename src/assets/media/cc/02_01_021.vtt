00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.338
You have completed Lesson One,

2
00:00:02.338 --> 00:00:04.643
Where Does SCM Fit in?

3
00:00:04.643 --> 00:00:06.947
In this section, you have been reminded

4
00:00:06.947 --> 00:00:09.424
of what Supply Chain Management involves

5
00:00:09.424 --> 00:00:12.932
and the advantages of a well coordinated supply chain.

6
00:00:12.932 --> 00:00:15.043
More importantly, you have discovered

7
00:00:15.043 --> 00:00:16.227
that the ultimate goal

8
00:00:16.227 --> 00:00:19.237
of any effective supply chain management system

9
00:00:19.237 --> 00:00:21.987
is to reduce inventory while making sure

10
00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:24.528
that products are available when needed.

11
00:00:24.528 --> 00:00:27.440
As a result, the demand for product will determine

12
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.147
the supply levels.

13
00:00:29.147 --> 00:00:32.123
You have learned the difference between goods and services,

14
00:00:32.123 --> 00:00:35.408
as well as how SCM is used throughout the supply chain

15
00:00:35.408 --> 00:00:38.565
to predict fluctuating demand, reduce costs

16
00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:40.763
and improve customer service.

17
00:00:40.763 --> 00:00:43.763
Now let's move on to the importance of logistics.
