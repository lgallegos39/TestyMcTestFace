00:00:00.303 --> 00:00:02.951
The main difference between customer management

2
00:00:02.951 --> 00:00:05.656
in industry and VA are the constraints

3
00:00:05.656 --> 00:00:07.875
that government encounters.

4
00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:10.963
Commercial firms can decide not to provide service

5
00:00:10.963 --> 00:00:12.978
to certain customer segments.

6
00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:15.690
The government does not have this flexibility.

7
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.112
Commercial firms can decide to discontinue

8
00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:21.386
certain end products or spare parts for products,

9
00:00:21.386 --> 00:00:23.724
whereas government agencies cannot choose

10
00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:25.839
which items they will handle.

11
00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.578
An example of customer management in government

12
00:00:28.578 --> 00:00:31.486
entails more customization and working closely

13
00:00:31.486 --> 00:00:33.253
with the clinical staff.

14
00:00:33.253 --> 00:00:35.995
This is due to meeting individual patient needs

15
00:00:35.995 --> 00:00:39.300
such as surgeries, medical, and personal needs.
