00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.285
Data transparency in healthcare

2
00:00:02.285 --> 00:00:06.301
is not just about data or creating analytical reports.

3
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:10.362
It's really about understanding cost, quality, risks,

4
00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:13.070
and consequences in a way that allows logistics

5
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.871
to evaluate performance more completely

6
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:17.984
and to take action faster.

7
00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:21.047
For consumers, healthcare transparency means

8
00:00:21.047 --> 00:00:23.579
having the right information at the right time

9
00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.240
and in the right form.

10
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.795
This is in order to engage in

11
00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:29.263
value-based healthcare decision-making.

12
00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:32.016
A general example of this would be when a patient

13
00:00:32.016 --> 00:00:33.815
gets an appointment card to come back

14
00:00:33.815 --> 00:00:35.848
to the audiology clinic.

15
00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:39.356
There is transparency in that the patient will get the date,

16
00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:43.015
time, clinic name, clinic location, and doctor

17
00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:45.416
they will be seeing upon the next visit.

18
00:00:45.416 --> 00:00:48.441
As a result, the patient does not have to guess when

19
00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:50.652
and where to go for any followups.
