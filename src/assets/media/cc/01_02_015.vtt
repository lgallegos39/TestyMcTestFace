00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.696
Walmart developed new techniques to track

2
00:00:02.696 --> 00:00:04.882
and to replenish inventory.

3
00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:07.832
Additionally, they use a distribution practice

4
00:00:07.832 --> 00:00:09.975
called cross-docking that allows goods

5
00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:12.454
to be continuously delivered to stores

6
00:00:12.454 --> 00:00:14.574
without sitting in inventory.

7
00:00:14.574 --> 00:00:16.582
The military has successfully used

8
00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:19.749
the same practice since the 1950s.

9
00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.240
Cross-docking is a logistics procedure

10
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.406
where products from the supplier or manufacturing plant

11
00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:27.556
come in to a temporary warehouse

12
00:00:27.556 --> 00:00:30.327
on the inbound transportation side.

13
00:00:30.327 --> 00:00:32.584
The products are then distributed directly

14
00:00:32.584 --> 00:00:35.084
to a customer or retail chain with minimal

15
00:00:35.084 --> 00:00:37.753
storage time from the temporary warehouse

16
00:00:37.753 --> 00:00:40.542
on the outbound transportation side.

17
00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:42.890
An additional benefit is they also build

18
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.812
closer supplier-customer relationships,

19
00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:48.157
particularly for fast-moving items

20
00:00:48.157 --> 00:00:51.036
where demand patterns are more easily determined,

21
00:00:51.036 --> 00:00:54.148
such as with diapers, skin care, and water products.
