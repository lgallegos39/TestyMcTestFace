00:00:00.275 --> 00:00:04.115
Often, the many parts of the supply chain work in silos

2
00:00:04.115 --> 00:00:05.755
or in isolation.

3
00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:08.784
Each silo attempts to optimize their supply chain

4
00:00:08.784 --> 00:00:10.451
to reduce cost.

5
00:00:10.451 --> 00:00:13.571
However, this can result in the entire supply chain

6
00:00:13.571 --> 00:00:16.139
operating sub-optimally.

7
00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.910
First, let's learn more about the individual parts

8
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.502
of supply chain processes.
