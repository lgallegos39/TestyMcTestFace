00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:02.578
The first flow, material,

2
00:00:02.578 --> 00:00:05.891
represents products and related services.

3
00:00:05.891 --> 00:00:07.702
While this has traditionally been

4
00:00:07.702 --> 00:00:10.415
an important focus of logisticians,

5
00:00:10.415 --> 00:00:14.566
it is also an important element in supply chain management.

6
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.295
It's important to understand that product flow

7
00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:20.546
is a two-way flow in today's environment.

8
00:00:20.546 --> 00:00:23.474
This is due to the growth of reverse logistics systems

9
00:00:23.474 --> 00:00:26.595
for returning products that are unacceptable to the buyer

10
00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:30.402
because they are damaged, obsolete, or worn out.

11
00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:32.485
There are numerous reasons for this growth

12
00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:34.686
in the reverse system.

13
00:00:34.686 --> 00:00:37.932
Additionally, networks for reverse systems usually

14
00:00:37.932 --> 00:00:41.798
have to be designed differently than forward systems.

15
00:00:41.798 --> 00:00:44.664
The location, size, and layout of facilities

16
00:00:44.664 --> 00:00:47.866
are frequently different and the transportation carriers

17
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.835
need to be utilized differently.
