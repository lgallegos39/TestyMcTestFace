00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:03.773
As we have learned in previous modules of this course,

2
00:00:03.773 --> 00:00:06.898
the policy hierarchy is an overview of the documents

3
00:00:06.898 --> 00:00:10.059
that define and govern the VA activities.

4
00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.136
Each level is described in order of precedence,

5
00:00:13.136 --> 00:00:15.285
with federal, state, and local laws

6
00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:17.578
at the top of the hierarchy.

7
00:00:17.578 --> 00:00:19.930
Knowing the differences in sources is critical

8
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.892
to successful implementation.

9
00:00:22.892 --> 00:00:27.352
VA directives provide mandatory department-wide policies.

10
00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:31.214
VA handbooks describe mandatory department-wide procedures

11
00:00:31.214 --> 00:00:33.104
or operational requirements

12
00:00:33.104 --> 00:00:36.497
implementing policies contained in directives.

13
00:00:36.497 --> 00:00:40.611
VA directives and handbooks are posted at the link provided,

14
00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:42.332

15
00:00:42.332 --> 00:00:45.341
