In this lesson,

2
00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:03.435
we discussed a few of the committees

3
00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:06.715
that work to ensure a well run supply chain

4
00:00:06.715 --> 00:00:07.915
and how their decisions

5
00:00:07.915 --> 00:00:10.243
affect supply chain management.

6
00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:11.367
Good work!

7
00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:12.649
When you are ready,

8
00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:14.629
let's move on to lesson three.
