00:00:00.572 --> 00:00:03.094
The VHA is implementing an enterprise-wide

2
00:00:03.094 --> 00:00:06.031
supply chain transformation that shifts the enterprise

3
00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:09.622
from siloed supply chain functions and practitioners

4
00:00:09.622 --> 00:00:12.620
to a unified supply chain organization.

5
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.025
The transformation streamlines the planning, ordering,

6
00:00:16.025 --> 00:00:19.508
installation, and maintenance of equipment and supplies.

7
00:00:19.508 --> 00:00:22.890
It also standardizes processes across VHA

8
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.467
while still retaining local autonomy and ordering capability

9
00:00:26.467 --> 00:00:29.467
through the use of ordering officer delegations.
