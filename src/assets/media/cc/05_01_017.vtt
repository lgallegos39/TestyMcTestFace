00:00:00.176 --> 00:00:02.781
On this screen you will be prompted to enter

2
00:00:02.781 --> 00:00:04.784
the BOC of the second line item.

3
00:00:04.784 --> 00:00:07.920
A BOC will be needed for every line item in the order.

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.769
After entering the quantity, you will enter the unit

5
00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.598

00:00:14.598 --> 00:00:17.134
You will bypass the delivery schedule.

7
00:00:17.134 --> 00:00:19.676

items then press enter to go to the next step.

00:00:23.182 --> 00:00:26.633
In this example we are only ordering two items.

Press enter to bypass the sub-control point

12
00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:33.740
unless otherwise specified.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.539
In this example we will bypass.

14
00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.412
Next, you will put in the delivery location.

15
00:00:39.412 --> 00:00:41.318
You are limited to 30 characters,

16
00:00:41.318 --> 00:00:43.595
so be concise within the limitations,

17
00:00:43.595 --> 00:00:45.683
such as room number and building,

18
00:00:45.683 --> 00:00:47.981
with a person's name if possible to allow

19
00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.597
for accurate delivery.

20
00:00:49.597 --> 00:00:52.544
Under the justification enter a brief comment

21
00:00:52.544 --> 00:00:55.014
on why you are ordering the items.
