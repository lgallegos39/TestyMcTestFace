00:00:00.493 --> 00:00:02.847
To meet the goals of the supply chain,

2
00:00:02.847 --> 00:00:05.452
good decisions must be made.

3
00:00:05.452 --> 00:00:09.007
Operational decisions are frequent and are often made daily

4
00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:12.184
by front-line staff and management alike.

5
00:00:12.184 --> 00:00:16.319
Shown is a list of types of decisions that are operational.

6
00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:18.644
Tactical decisions are less frequent,

7
00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:20.398
often being made to affect items

8
00:00:20.398 --> 00:00:22.666
on a three- to 12-month basis.

9
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:26.907
These decisions generally have large-scale consequences

10
00:00:26.907 --> 00:00:30.152
such as personnel changes, policy updates,

11
00:00:30.152 --> 00:00:32.378
or general process changes.

12
00:00:32.378 --> 00:00:34.604
Strategic decisions are infrequent

13
00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:37.742
and impact items more than one year out.

14
00:00:37.742 --> 00:00:39.947
Strategic decision making is essentially

15
00:00:39.947 --> 00:00:42.165
longterm planning and improvement

16
00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:45.200
where milestones are set and goals are established

17
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.883
to arrive at a longterm decision point.
