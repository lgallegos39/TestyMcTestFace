00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.170
Once you complete the prior screen prompts,

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.605
you will be asked for the budget object code

3
00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:07.471
or BOC number.

4
00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:09.098
It is very important to input

5
00:00:09.098 --> 00:00:11.424
the correct information for this.

6
00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:15.962
In this example, we will use the BOC number 2632.

7
00:00:15.962 --> 00:00:19.027
Next, input the quantity to be ordered.

8
00:00:19.027 --> 00:00:22.216
If there are more items, you will continue to input them

9
00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:24.268
as in the example above.

10
00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:26.863
If the item does not have an IMF number,

11
00:00:26.863 --> 00:00:28.936
you will enter pass to that question

12
00:00:28.936 --> 00:00:32.135
and then say yes to edit the description.

13
00:00:32.135 --> 00:00:35.403
It is always best to enter this information in detail,

14
00:00:35.403 --> 00:00:37.474
and as this is an open text field,

15
00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:40.381
there should be ample room to do so.

16
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:43.053
For the above example, we enter minimal data

17
00:00:43.053 --> 00:00:45.976
so that you can see what can go into the description.
