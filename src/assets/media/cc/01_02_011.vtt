00:00:00.336 --> 00:00:02.923
Now that you have been introduced to the different types

2
00:00:02.923 --> 00:00:07.134
of inventory, let's talk about holding inventory.

3
00:00:07.134 --> 00:00:10.846
Planning for unexpected occurrences is a big part of SCM

4
00:00:10.846 --> 00:00:13.638
which requires balance and precision.

5
00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:15.907
After all, holding inventory,

6
00:00:15.907 --> 00:00:18.853
regardless of the reason, isn't free.

7
00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:21.412
There are storage costs to consider,

8
00:00:21.412 --> 00:00:24.532
as well as additional ordering and handling costs.

9
00:00:24.532 --> 00:00:27.737
There may be the opportunity to spend the money

10
00:00:27.737 --> 00:00:30.957
on other items that may be just as important.

11
00:00:30.957 --> 00:00:33.267
All these items must be considered

12
00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:36.179
before making the choice to hold inventory.
