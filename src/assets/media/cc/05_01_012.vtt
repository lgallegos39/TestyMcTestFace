1
00:00:00.417 --> 00:00:04.371
In the purchasing process, there is transparency in roles.

2
00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:07.275
Each employee will have a part of the purchasing process

3
00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:10.694
with a clear separation of duties and, as a result,

4
00:00:10.694 --> 00:00:13.425
one employee does not perform more than one role

5
00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:15.091
in the purchasing process.

6
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:18.003
This is purposeful and prevents fraud and error,

7
00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:20.860
particularly in the purchase card program.

8
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.189
Let's walk through an example of this.

9
00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.851
Over the next few screens, you will see an example

10
00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:27.823
of an item request as it appears

11
00:00:27.823 --> 00:00:29.793
in the VistA inventory system.

12
00:00:29.793 --> 00:00:32.514
You will see how having transparency in roles

13
00:00:32.514 --> 00:00:35.975
creates checks and balances in the procurement process.

14
00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:39.783
In this scenario, an order is needed for cardiology.

15
00:00:39.783 --> 00:00:43.776
Employee One will request the items in the inventory system.

16
00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:46.967
In this example, that would be a lab employee.

17
00:00:46.967 --> 00:00:51.237
Employee Two will create a 2237 to request the order,

18
00:00:51.237 --> 00:00:54.811
and that would be a lab supervisor or chief in this case.

19
00:00:54.811 --> 00:00:58.625
Employee Three, the accountable officer or logistics chief

20
00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:02.708
or designated staff, will approve the 2237 order.
