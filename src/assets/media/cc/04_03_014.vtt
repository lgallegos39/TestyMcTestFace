1
00:00:00.357 --> 00:00:02.751
Cost avoidance is the primary outcome

2
00:00:02.751 --> 00:00:05.312
of efficiency gains in the federal government.

3
00:00:05.312 --> 00:00:08.116
Because the VA cannot cross appropriations

4
00:00:08.116 --> 00:00:11.131
nor save for investment in subsequent years,

5
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:13.559
the funds are not technically saved,

6
00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.254
yet can potentially be reallocated.

7
00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:18.651
A common example is when there are realized

8
00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:21.660
cost savings in non-patient care areas

9
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.455
which allow for a reallocation of those funds

10
00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:27.336
towards direct or indirect patient care

11
00:00:27.336 --> 00:00:29.514
areas in that same fiscal year.

12
00:00:29.514 --> 00:00:32.190
This scenario drives more efficiency efforts

13
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.691
as patient care funding is short in most years.

14
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:38.240
As an example, a supply chain department

15
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.864
implements the use of 5S in their secondary supply closets.

16
00:00:42.864 --> 00:00:45.739
A 5S is a lean tool used to clean,

17
00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.102
sort, and standardize an area.

18
00:00:48.102 --> 00:00:50.790
By doing so, they have been able to reduce

19
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.386
the stock on hand, reduce stock-outs,

20
00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.809
and reduce the amount of time needed

21
00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.790
to scan all areas in the morning.

22
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.734
The time saved from the reduction

23
00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:02.650
in scanning requirement was 25%.

24
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.439
That 25% savings in time allowed for those supply techs

25
00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.131
to now spend time maintaining

26
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:10.204
the primary area more effectively.

27
00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:11.886
This reallocation of time

28
00:01:11.886 --> 00:01:14.079
has allowed for a further reduction

29
00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:16.264
of stock on hand and freed up space.

30
00:01:16.264 --> 00:01:19.256
That space was able to be reallocated and converted

31
00:01:19.256 --> 00:01:21.276
to a mental health clinic space,

32
00:01:21.276 --> 00:01:24.620
which has now increased patient access to mental health.

33
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.306
As you can see, the impacts to the operation is profound

34
00:01:28.306 --> 00:01:30.690
despite our inability to save

35
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.434
and reinvest money in future years.
