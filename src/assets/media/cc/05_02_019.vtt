00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.782
What are Operating Environments?

2
00:00:02.782 --> 00:00:07.243
They are clinics, units, and secondary or storage areas.

3
00:00:07.243 --> 00:00:08.482
When a company wants to look at the

4
00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:10.830
performance of its supply chain,

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.686
there are a great many metrics that can be used.

6
00:00:13.686 --> 00:00:16.013
Each supply chain performance metric gives

7
00:00:16.013 --> 00:00:19.612
a slightly different view of a piece of the supply chain.

8
00:00:19.612 --> 00:00:21.747
The important decision for any company

9
00:00:21.747 --> 00:00:25.296
is to prioritize which supply chain metrics are important

10
00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:27.269
and how they will be used.

11
00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.944
Many companies use supply chain performance metrics

12
00:00:29.944 --> 00:00:32.662
that are easy to calculate, but may not necessarily

13
00:00:32.662 --> 00:00:34.140
give a true indication of

14
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.163
how the supply chain is performing.

15
00:00:37.163 --> 00:00:39.585
Metrics for the storage areas would consist

16
00:00:39.585 --> 00:00:43.507
of the types of items in the storage area such as gloves,

17
00:00:43.507 --> 00:00:45.248
the number of items in the storage area,

18
00:00:45.248 --> 00:00:49.630
like 10 boxes of gloves, and the levels set for those items.

19
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.538
For instance, level of eight boxes,

20
00:00:52.538 --> 00:00:54.821
and when the area gets below that level,

21
00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.857
they are replenished.

22
00:00:56.857 --> 00:00:59.042
Some reagents for the laboratory primary

23
00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:01.106
need to be refrigerated.

24
00:01:01.106 --> 00:01:03.408
They will come in a cold storage container

25
00:01:03.408 --> 00:01:07.399
and are taken directly to the area to be refrigerated.

26
00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:08.772
These items need to be refrigerated

27
00:01:08.772 --> 00:01:12.200
to maintain their integrity until used by the service.

28
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.780
If they are not refrigerated,

29
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.388
they will deteriorate in a short time frame

30
00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:17.925
and cannot be used for testing

31
00:01:17.925 --> 00:01:19.987
due to the changes of acidity.

32
00:01:19.987 --> 00:01:23.174
This is a great example of why metrics are needed.
