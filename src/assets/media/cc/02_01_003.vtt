00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:01.699
As we have learned,

2
00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:04.381
Supply Chain Management involves coordinating

3
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:06.659
and integrating the flow of material

4
00:00:06.659 --> 00:00:08.680
from the vendor to the end user.

5
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.341
The ultimate goal of any effective Supply Chain

6
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:13.661
Management system is to reduce inventory

7
00:00:13.661 --> 00:00:16.175
while making sure that products are available

8
00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:17.175
when needed.

9
00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:20.461
Efficient and effective Supply Chain Management

10
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:22.040
is critical to VA,

11
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.683
both financially and in delivering quality patient care.

12
00:00:25.683 --> 00:00:27.859
Better hospital Supply Chain Management

13
00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.901
leads to better quality of care

14
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:31.843
and supports patient safety,

15
00:00:31.843 --> 00:00:33.960
according to a new Cardinal Health survey

16
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.701
of hospital staff and decision makers.

17
00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:39.059
Despite respondents rating their supply chain process

18
00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.360
as good, one in four hospital staff

19
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.744
have seen or heard of expired product being used

20
00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:46.323
on a patient,

21
00:00:46.323 --> 00:00:48.600
and 18% have seen or heard of a patient

22
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.899
being harmed due to a lack of necessary supplies.
