00:00:00.462 --> 00:00:03.008
The improved responsiveness and flexibility

2
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:04.896
that comes form improved planning

3
00:00:04.896 --> 00:00:07.000
can decrease delivery lead times

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.931
by shipping items from locations

5
00:00:08.931 --> 00:00:10.744
closer to the customer.

6
00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:13.463
As an example, some VA hospitals

7
00:00:13.463 --> 00:00:15.150
are located near the warehouses

8
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.289
of the facility's Prime Vendor.

9
00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.001
If the hospital orders four by four gauze

10
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.033
from the Prime Vendor, they can expect

11
00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:23.703
to receive it the next day,

12
00:00:23.703 --> 00:00:26.505
especially since it is a core item.

13
00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:28.858
The Prime Vendor will stock core items

14
00:00:28.858 --> 00:00:31.667
in their facility to ensure timely delivery

15
00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:34.643
reducing the usual two to three days to one day.
