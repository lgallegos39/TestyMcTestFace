00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.174
There is also transparency in the inventory system.

00:00:04.174 --> 00:00:07.362
Authorized users can access the GIP system

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:09.567
and look up information by item number

4
00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:11.489
in the primary inventory.

5
00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:15.726
At that point, they can see quantities and associated costs.

00:00:15.726 --> 00:00:17.589
Therefore, nothing is hidden.

7
00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.160
