00:00:00.421 --> 00:00:02.367
An important business component

2
00:00:02.367 --> 00:00:05.191
of effectively managing the hospital's supply chain,

3
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:07.099
is the efficiency and the operations

4
00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:09.391
it supports and promotes.

5
00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:12.292
However, even more important is managing

6
00:00:12.292 --> 00:00:14.588
the hospital's supply chain because it improves

7
00:00:14.588 --> 00:00:16.644
patient care and safety.

8
00:00:16.644 --> 00:00:18.842
If or when supplies are used on patients

9
00:00:18.842 --> 00:00:20.896
and those supplies are expired,

10
00:00:20.896 --> 00:00:23.821
stored incorrectly or damaged, it can lead

11
00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:26.571
to patient safety issues or sentinel events

12
00:00:26.571 --> 00:00:29.660
where the patient dies as a result.

13
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.972
The first line of defense to prevent this

14
00:00:31.972 --> 00:00:34.276
is to have all staff manage the supplies

15
00:00:34.276 --> 00:00:36.907
within their control effectively.

16
00:00:36.907 --> 00:00:39.642
For example, the warehouse staff would manage

17
00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:43.083
how they handle supplies once they come into the facility.

18
00:00:43.083 --> 00:00:45.404
Inventory staff would manage the supplies

19
00:00:45.404 --> 00:00:47.904
as they store and distribute to the clinical areas

20
00:00:47.904 --> 00:00:50.965
by storing properly, rotating, and checking

21
00:00:50.965 --> 00:00:52.868
expiration dates.

22
00:00:52.868 --> 00:00:55.204
The clinical staff would monitor storage areas

23
00:00:55.204 --> 00:00:58.781
for cleanliness, make sure supplies are stored properly,

24
00:00:58.781 --> 00:01:01.175
rotate stock, and make sure that supplies

25
00:01:01.175 --> 00:01:02.963
used are not expired.
