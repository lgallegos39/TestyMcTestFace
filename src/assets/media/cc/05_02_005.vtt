00:00:00.165 --> 00:00:03.172
The turnover rate is important, because it shows

2
00:00:03.172 --> 00:00:06.580
movement of items from the primary storage areas to the

3
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.994
units for distribution points for patient care.

4
00:00:09.994 --> 00:00:13.507
If you deliver the right items at the right times to

5
00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:16.360
needed units, you will show a distribution of supplies.

6
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.680
The inactive rate is important because it identifies

7
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.071
the percentage of items with low or no usage.

8
00:00:24.071 --> 00:00:27.146
This could be an item that you deliver to a unit

9
00:00:27.146 --> 00:00:28.651
that is not used.

10
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:31.806
In this case, you would talk to the area staff to see

11
00:00:31.806 --> 00:00:34.378
if it is still needed in the unit.
