00:00:00.227 --> 00:00:02.125
First, talk to the nurse to see

2
00:00:02.125 --> 00:00:03.949
what her exact needs are and

3
00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:06.593
to get the exact item information.

4
00:00:06.593 --> 00:00:10.195
Next, research to see if the item is currently carried

5
00:00:10.195 --> 00:00:12.627
or a substitute can be used.

6
00:00:12.627 --> 00:00:15.838
If so, supply this item to the nurse.

7
00:00:15.838 --> 00:00:19.315
If not, check to see if the item is on VA Excess

8
00:00:19.315 --> 00:00:21.129
and obtain it that way.

9
00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:23.390
Be sure to set levels and create space

10
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.675
for the item in the primary and secondary areas.

11
00:00:26.675 --> 00:00:29.534
In this case, the cardiac cath lab.

12
00:00:29.534 --> 00:00:32.734
If the item is not available on VA Excess,

13
00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:35.635
go to CPARC to get approval.

14
00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:38.632
Remembering to communicate this information to the nurse

15
00:00:38.632 --> 00:00:41.596
along with the time it will take to get the item.

16
00:00:41.596 --> 00:00:43.529
Once you have received approval,

17
00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:45.961
order the item for the area.

18
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:48.574
Next, receive the item into the facility

19
00:00:48.574 --> 00:00:51.230
and set levels and create space for the item

20
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.914
in the primary and secondary areas.

21
00:00:53.914 --> 00:00:56.901
In this case, the cardiac cath lab.

22
00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:58.650
It is very important to remember

23
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.099
to communicate with the nurse during the entire process.
