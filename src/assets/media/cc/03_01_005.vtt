00:00:00.728 --> 00:00:03.242
By managing the supply chain system

2
00:00:03.242 --> 00:00:06.101
there can be a shift in how inventories are stores

3
00:00:06.101 --> 00:00:09.176
and amounts spent on medical supplies.

4
00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:11.502
If levels are managed accurately,

5
00:00:11.502 --> 00:00:15.293
then the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor, or MSPV,

6
00:00:15.293 --> 00:00:18.312
would have the ownership of holding the supplies.

7
00:00:18.312 --> 00:00:20.381
This would shift from logistics holding

8
00:00:20.381 --> 00:00:23.417
a majority of the supplies in the inventory systems

9
00:00:23.417 --> 00:00:25.700
for more than 15 days, which in turn

10
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.399
would decrease the amount of stock on hand,

11
00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.432
decrease long supply, and decrease the amount of money

12
00:00:31.432 --> 00:00:33.130
tied up in holding supplies

13
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.978
for very long periods of time.
