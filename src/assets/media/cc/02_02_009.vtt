00:00:00.408 --> 00:00:03.525
Inventory management involves formulating and implementing

2
00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:07.612
inventory policies that support organizational goals.

3
00:00:07.612 --> 00:00:10.009
Inventory management activities include,

4
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.716
but are not always limited to,

5
00:00:11.716 --> 00:00:16.198
forecasting, demand planning, and control activities.

6
00:00:16.198 --> 00:00:19.167
In government, the user's mission-based requirements

7
00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:23.443
drive inventory and inventory management requirements.

8
00:00:23.443 --> 00:00:27.064
Inventory managers use end-item forecasts

9
00:00:27.064 --> 00:00:30.424
such as sales, production, or maintenance forecasts

10
00:00:30.424 --> 00:00:34.568
to derive forecasts for individual item numbers.

11
00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:36.446
They formulate inventory rules

12
00:00:36.446 --> 00:00:39.447
that affect safety stock levels, lot sizes,

13
00:00:39.447 --> 00:00:41.829
and replenishment lead times

14
00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.835
in order to support anticipated demand.

15
00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:48.490
Additionally, they manage our control item inventories

16
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.299
according to the established inventory rules.
