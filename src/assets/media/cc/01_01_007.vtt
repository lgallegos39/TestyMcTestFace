00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:03.699
This image demonstrates how information, material,

2
00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:07.345
and goods flow up and down the supply chain process.

3
00:00:07.345 --> 00:00:10.139
Goods flow downstream from the supplier,

4
00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.895
and their supplier's supplier, to the manufacturer.

5
00:00:13.895 --> 00:00:17.135
Manufacturers ship items directly to consumers,

6
00:00:17.135 --> 00:00:19.926
or to wholesalers or retailers.

7
00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:23.808
Retailers, in turn, sell directly to consumers.

8
00:00:23.808 --> 00:00:26.160
While it may seem that cutting out the retailer

9
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.400
and wholesaler would reduce steps,

10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.862
there may be additional transportation costs

11
00:00:30.862 --> 00:00:33.411
and other factors that cause supply chains

12
00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:37.030
to use wholesalers, distributors, and retailers.

13
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.870
Information flows both upstream and downstream.

14
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.819
Communication from the retailer to the manufacturer

15
00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:46.567
enables a more efficient supply chain.

16
00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:48.786
When products are defective or returned,

17
00:00:48.786 --> 00:00:51.206
they flow upstream as reverse goods flow

18
00:00:51.206 --> 00:00:53.598
from the consumer back through the retailer,

19
00:00:53.598 --> 00:00:57.608
potentially for the manufacturer rework or dispose of.

20
00:00:57.608 --> 00:01:00.307
This graphic also shows internal coordination

21
00:01:00.307 --> 00:01:02.579
between the distributor and retailer,

22
00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.507
which are both operated by organization X.
