00:00:00.242 --> 00:00:02.819
Of course, the biggest challenge of supply chain

2
00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:05.989
management is to match supply to demand.

3
00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:08.669
How do you ensure that you have enough inventory

4
00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:10.779
without having too much?

5
00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:15.000
First, it helps to understand exactly what inventory is.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.139
Inventory is stock of any item or resource

7
00:00:18.139 --> 00:00:20.013
used in an organization.

8
00:00:20.013 --> 00:00:22.459
This can be anything from raw materials

9
00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:25.240
used to create a product, to the people or resources

10
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.250
used to provide a service, such as IT support

11
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.338
for an organization's computer network.

12
00:00:31.338 --> 00:00:34.752
This graphic visualizes the optimal order quantity.

13
00:00:34.752 --> 00:00:37.581
The red line represents your annual holding,

14
00:00:37.581 --> 00:00:40.890
or carrying costs, where the more you keep on hand,

15
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.211
the more it costs you in space and investment.

16
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:47.219
The blue line represents your annual ordering costs,

17
00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.539
where the more you have on hand, the less you must order,

18
00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.181
therefore, the lower your total ordering costs.

19
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:56.651
Total ordering costs include shipping costs

20
00:00:56.651 --> 00:01:00.251
and handling costs, tangible and intangible.

21
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:02.638
The objective in the diagram is to minimize

22
00:01:02.638 --> 00:01:06.525
the combined total cost represented by the green line.

23
00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:09.611
The minimal costs point occur where the ordering costs

24
00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:13.778
and holding costs are equal to one another, point Q.
