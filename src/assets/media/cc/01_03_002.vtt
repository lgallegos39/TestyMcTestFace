1
00:00:00.248 --> 00:00:02.482
Industry and government use many of the same

2
00:00:02.482 --> 00:00:06.045
procurement techniques to obtain goods and services.

3
00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:08.960
Examples of these similarities are Prime Vendors

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.557
to take advantage of special capabilities of suppliers,

5
00:00:12.557 --> 00:00:15.728
on-demand manufacturing for low-demand parts,

6
00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:19.173
strategic alliances to develop integrated partnerships,

7
00:00:19.173 --> 00:00:22.629
reverse auctioning for price sensitive commodities,

8
00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:24.369
and performance-based contracting

9
00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.035
to achieve a certain end result.

10
00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:29.434
Perhaps the biggest difference between government

11
00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:31.841
and industry is that government agencies

12
00:00:31.841 --> 00:00:33.968
have special federal regulations

13
00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:36.617
that required a diverse base of suppliers.

14
00:00:36.617 --> 00:00:39.277
An additional difference is government differentiation

15
00:00:39.277 --> 00:00:41.671
between procurement and acquisition.

16
00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:46.190
Acquisition may be likened to capital purchases in industry.

17
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.611
An example of procurement in government would include

18
00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:51.995
VA hospitals buying medical supplies from the Prime Vendor.
