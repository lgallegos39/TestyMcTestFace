00:00:00.557 --> 00:00:02.094
The improved responsiveness and flexibility

2
00:00:02.094 --> 00:00:04.575
that comes from improved planning

3
00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:06.717
can help find cost savings,

4
00:00:06.717 --> 00:00:10.600
such as buying items that are used regularly in bulk.

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.858
Good planning can also regulate the budget

6
00:00:12.858 --> 00:00:14.920
for the fund control point

7
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.261
and improve purchasing by consolidating orders

8
00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:19.960
with a Prime Vendor rather than individual purchases

9
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.979
with various outside vendors.

10
00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:26.355
For example, an employee purchases 4x4 gauze

11
00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:29.197
from Cardinal, who is a Prime Vendor.

12
00:00:29.197 --> 00:00:31.981
Since this is the Prime Vendor for that facility,

13
00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:35.080
the employee will be able to order and receive the items

14
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.891
within a few days, thus reducing the cost and lead times.
