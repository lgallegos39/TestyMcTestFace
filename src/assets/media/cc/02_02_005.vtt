00:00:00.346 --> 00:00:03.179
Procurement is the acquisition of goods or services

2
00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.313
for the organization.

3
00:00:05.313 --> 00:00:08.521
It typically involves market research and contracting,

4
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:11.610
including negotiation and buying.

5
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.546
It also includes providing internal customer service,

6
00:00:14.546 --> 00:00:19.017
staying within budget, and ensuring that goods and services

7
00:00:19.017 --> 00:00:21.202
are available in the right quantity and quality

8
00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:23.540
at the right time and place.

9
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.161
Basic procurement may be limited

10
00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:28.216
to actual buying of goods and services,

11
00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:29.425
staying within budget,

12
00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:31.937
and ensuring that goods and services are available

13
00:00:31.937 --> 00:00:34.036
in the right quantity and quality

14
00:00:34.036 --> 00:00:36.698
and at the right time and place.

15
00:00:36.698 --> 00:00:37.857
Perhaps the biggest difference

16
00:00:37.857 --> 00:00:39.395
between government and industry

17
00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:40.928
is that government agencies

18
00:00:40.928 --> 00:00:42.761
have special federal regulations

19
00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:45.563
that require a diverse base of suppliers.
