00:00:00.346 --> 00:00:02.682
The process of bringing all supplies

2
00:00:02.682 --> 00:00:06.304
through the CPRC sets a level of standardization.

3
00:00:06.304 --> 00:00:09.242
In other words, instead of having logistics order

4
00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:11.332
20 types of nail clippers,

5
00:00:11.332 --> 00:00:14.969
one standard nail clipper will be ordered for the facility.

6
00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.543
This would create a cost savings as well,

7
00:00:17.543 --> 00:00:19.336
due to the money not being tied up

8
00:00:19.336 --> 00:00:21.623
in having supplies that are not used

9
00:00:21.623 --> 00:00:23.668
due to staff preferences for an item

10
00:00:23.668 --> 00:00:25.825
that performs the same function.

11
00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:28.464
For example, if nail clippers were purchased

12
00:00:28.464 --> 00:00:30.347
for 10 units in the hospital,

13
00:00:30.347 --> 00:00:32.506
imagine that each unit had a preference

14
00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:34.414
of the type of clipper used.

15
00:00:34.414 --> 00:00:37.351
The breakdown would be as demonstrated in this table.

16
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:38.687
As you can see,

17
00:00:38.687 --> 00:00:43.482
each month the facility would spend $1,051 on the item,

18
00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:46.649
and the annual cost would be $12,612.
