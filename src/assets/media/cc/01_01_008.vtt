00:00:00.585 --> 00:00:02.400
Properly executed supply chains

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.854
can make a world of difference in any company

3
00:00:04.854 --> 00:00:06.602
and can help increase savings

4
00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:09.763
as well as reduce overall expenses.

5
00:00:09.763 --> 00:00:12.322
By focusing on the flow of the supply chain,

6
00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:14.585
we are finding that it's becoming easier

7
00:00:14.585 --> 00:00:17.813
to serve Veterans without a delay in service.

8
00:00:17.813 --> 00:00:20.309
For the Veteran, the face of the VA

9
00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:22.430
is usually seen as the medical staff

10
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.548
who provides their health services

11
00:00:24.548 --> 00:00:27.961
or the benefits counselor who helps them with their claims.

12
00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.690
Though Veterans don't readily see

13
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.352
supply chain management at work in the background,

14
00:00:32.352 --> 00:00:34.328
all operations would cease to exist

15
00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:37.859
if the supply chain did not function properly.

16
00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:40.006
Because of this, it is imperative

17
00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:42.659
to meet our customers' needs each and every time.
