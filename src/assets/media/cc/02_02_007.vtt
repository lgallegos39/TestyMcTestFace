00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.742
To reduce cycle times

2
00:00:01.742 --> 00:00:03.335
is to decrease the time it takes

3
00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:06.359
to perform a process from beginning to end.

4
00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.552
The reduction can be accomplished in three ways.

5
00:00:09.552 --> 00:00:11.878
First, you can reengineer the process

6
00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:14.907
to reflect emerging supply chain practices.

7
00:00:14.907 --> 00:00:18.499
Second, you can eliminate non-value-added steps

8
00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:20.858
in order to streamline the process.

9
00:00:20.858 --> 00:00:24.429
Lastly, you could apply new technology to the process

10
00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.459
and see if that accomplishes the goal.
