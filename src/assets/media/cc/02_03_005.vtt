00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:21.241
Why should you worry about competition?

00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:25.075
VA's goals are critical to servicing the Veteran population.

10
00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:28.599
As a result of VA's visibility and transparency,

11
00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.475
it is often criticized for its performance.

12
00:00:31.475 --> 00:00:34.775
However, due to the importance of the niche service

13
00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:37.517
provided to a specialized population,

14
00:00:37.517 --> 00:00:39.669
VA and officials from Congress

00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:43.211
believe that VA compares well with their competitors.

17
00:00:46.724 --> 00:00:48.613

18
00:00:48.613 --> 00:00:50.916
in six out of nine categories.

19
00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:54.876
VA hospitals also had improved performance over mortality

20
00:00:54.876 --> 00:00:58.162
and readmissions numbers than the private hospitals.

21
00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:00.301

22
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:02.651
