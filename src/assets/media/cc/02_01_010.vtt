00:00:00.304 --> 00:00:03.596
When supply levels meet the demand of clinical areas,

2
00:00:03.596 --> 00:00:05.578
you will have equilibrium.

3
00:00:05.578 --> 00:00:08.653
Equilibrium is defined as a situation in which

4
00:00:08.653 --> 00:00:12.254
supply and demand are matched and prices are stable.

5
00:00:12.254 --> 00:00:15.007
In other words, you will have the right product,

6
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:17.338
at the right time, in the right amount

7
00:00:17.338 --> 00:00:19.385
for staff to care for patients.

8
00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:22.479
To further clarify, when the demand and amount of supplies

9
00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:26.096
are equal, you will be able to meet customers needs.

10
00:00:26.096 --> 00:00:29.619
An example would be gowns used in the women's clinic.

11
00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.624
The demand for the women's clinic is for 100 gowns per week.

12
00:00:33.624 --> 00:00:37.241
The logistics staff supplies 100 gowns per week.

13
00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:40.240
In this example, supply meets demand.

14
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.900
As a result, the women's clinic has exactly

15
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.491
the amount needed to provide to patients.
