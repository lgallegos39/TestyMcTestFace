00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.358
Predicting fluctuating demands

2
00:00:02.358 --> 00:00:05.690
can make operating the supply chain very challenging.

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.236
As the customer's demand changes,

4
00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:11.651
the supply chain must be able to react accordingly.

5
00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:15.053
For instance, if a new clinic is added to the hospital,

6
00:00:15.053 --> 00:00:18.116
then the overall demand for supplies will increase.

7
00:00:18.116 --> 00:00:20.685
However, if units in the hospital shut down

8
00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:22.197
for weeks or months,

9
00:00:22.197 --> 00:00:25.179
then the need for these same supplies will decrease.

10
00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.373
As the result of changes in demand,

11
00:00:27.373 --> 00:00:30.387
staff can take actions that impact inventory,

12
00:00:30.387 --> 00:00:32.559
whether positive or negative.

13
00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.446
Some of these impacts can include holding inventory

14
00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:37.476
to combat uncertainty.

15
00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:40.525
If there's an incident that occurs with the supplier,

16
00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:44.091
there may be uncertainty whether an item might be available.

17
00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:46.638
As a result, the logistics staff will order

18
00:00:46.638 --> 00:00:49.057
and hold onto the excessive amounts of supplies

19
00:00:49.057 --> 00:00:51.720
in case there could be stock outages.

20
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.360
There was a time when there were shortages of saline

21
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.956
that is used in the OR,

22
00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:59.112
and it was difficult to obtain from any vendors.

23
00:00:59.112 --> 00:01:02.849
As a result, many facilities purchased the saline in bulk,

24
00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:04.267
anticipating that vendors

25
00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:06.733
would not have an adequate supply later.

26
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.470
This prediction came to pass,

27
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.485
and saline was difficult to obtain when needed.

28
00:01:11.485 --> 00:01:14.137
The facilities that purchased the saline in bulk

29
00:01:14.137 --> 00:01:16.931
in advance were able to continue with operations.
