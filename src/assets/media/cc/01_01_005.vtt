1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.853
The second flow indicated is the information flow,

2
00:00:03.853 --> 00:00:06.627
which has become an extremely important factor for success

3
00:00:06.627 --> 00:00:09.123
in supply chain management.

4
00:00:09.123 --> 00:00:13.048
Traditionally, we have viewed information as flowing in the

5
00:00:13.048 --> 00:00:15.096
opposite direction of products.

6
00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:17.549
That is, from the market or customer back to the

7
00:00:17.549 --> 00:00:20.404
wholesalers, manufacturers, and vendors.

8
00:00:20.404 --> 00:00:23.949
The information is primarily demand or sales data, which

9
00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.595
is the trigger for replenishment and the basis

10
00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:27.928
for forecasting.
