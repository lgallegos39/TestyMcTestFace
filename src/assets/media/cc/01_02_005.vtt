00:00:00.514 --> 00:00:02.258
A way of improving quality

2
00:00:02.258 --> 00:00:04.064
would be to redesign equipment

3
00:00:04.064 --> 00:00:07.191
to help fit VA's needs by working with suppliers

4
00:00:07.191 --> 00:00:10.578
to reduce or remove unnecessary functions.

5
00:00:10.578 --> 00:00:12.800
An example of this is to place software

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.022
on commercial scanners so that they can speak

7
00:00:15.022 --> 00:00:16.842
to our VistA system.

8
00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:19.768
This would be a modification to equipment.

9
00:00:19.768 --> 00:00:22.188
Another way would be to repackage items

10
00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:25.516
to reduce the storage space used to hold the item.

11
00:00:25.516 --> 00:00:27.322
An example of this is to procure

12
00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:31.298
single cauterization tools instead of a box of 20.

13
00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:34.394
That way, if a small number is needed in the area,

14
00:00:34.394 --> 00:00:36.707
you don't have to worry about storing 20.
