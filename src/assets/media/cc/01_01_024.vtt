1
00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:04.079
The action or inactions of each member of the supply chain

2
00:00:04.079 --> 00:00:05.928
add or detract from the value

3
00:00:05.928 --> 00:00:08.576
the customer ultimately receives.

4
00:00:08.576 --> 00:00:11.101
A challenge for SCM is to get each member

5
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:13.814
of the supply chain customer-focused

6
00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:15.766
so the members constantly question

7
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.364
each activity or process they perform

8
00:00:18.364 --> 00:00:21.713
in terms of ultimate value to the customer.

9
00:00:21.713 --> 00:00:24.889
Put simply, the focus should be on process,

10
00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:27.932
not individual function in integrating best practices

11
00:00:27.932 --> 00:00:31.001
in coordination across all organizations

12
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:32.914
involved in the supply chain.

13
00:00:32.914 --> 00:00:36.664
Supply Chain Operations Reference model, or SCOR,

14
00:00:36.664 --> 00:00:40.098
provides a unique framework that links business process,

15
00:00:40.098 --> 00:00:43.287
metrics, best practices and technology

16
00:00:43.287 --> 00:00:46.119
into a unified structure to support communication

17
00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:48.097
among supply chain partners

18
00:00:48.097 --> 00:00:51.298
and to improve the effectiveness of supply chain management

19
00:00:51.298 --> 00:00:54.334
and related supply chain improvement activities.

20
00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:56.950
SCOR spans all customer interactions

21
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.445
from order entry to paid invoice.

22
00:00:59.445 --> 00:01:02.390
It includes all physical material transactions

23
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.731
from suppliers' supplier to customers' customer,

24
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:08.178
including equipment, supplies,

25
00:01:08.178 --> 00:01:11.776
spare parts, bulk product, and software.

26
00:01:11.776 --> 00:01:14.849
And finally, it involves all market interactions

27
00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:17.332
from the understanding of aggregate demand

28
00:01:17.332 --> 00:01:19.334
to the fulfillment of each order.
