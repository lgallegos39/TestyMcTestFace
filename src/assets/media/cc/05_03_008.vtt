00:00:00.718 --> 00:00:03.374
Joe also logs into the DCEP website

2
00:00:03.374 --> 00:00:06.765
to look at the null fields report from med-surg.

3
00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:08.629
He notices that there are 10 items

4
00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:10.277
that are missing information.

5
00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:12.772
Are the items in DCEP valid?

6
00:00:12.772 --> 00:00:17.407
Do the items need to be removed from the inventory system?

7
00:00:17.407 --> 00:00:20.743
Do the items need to be updated in the inventory system?

8
00:00:20.743 --> 00:00:24.397
In this example, Joe has checked all of the above

9
00:00:24.397 --> 00:00:27.664
and has verified that the items are indeed valid.

10
00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:30.793
He finds that on Friday, 10 new items were approved

11
00:00:30.793 --> 00:00:34.960
by the CPRC and item master file IMF numbers were created.

12
00:00:36.368 --> 00:00:40.047
As a result, the location to place the items was missing.

13
00:00:40.047 --> 00:00:42.772
After some research, Joe has found where the items

14
00:00:42.772 --> 00:00:46.503
will be placed in the primary and distribution areas.

15
00:00:46.503 --> 00:00:49.214
He communicated this information to the clinical staff

16
00:00:49.214 --> 00:00:50.874
of that area, and worked with them

17
00:00:50.874 --> 00:00:53.504
to set appropriate levels, and created levels

18
00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:57.267
in the primary storage area to reflect the correction.

19
00:00:57.267 --> 00:01:00.365
He created space for storage, updated the locations

20
00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:03.373
in VistA, and created new labels.

21
00:01:03.373 --> 00:01:06.372
As a result of the report, Joe was able to update

22
00:01:06.372 --> 00:01:08.493
the inventory management system.
