1
00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:03.238
Supply chain management is a critical operation

2
00:00:03.238 --> 00:00:04.843
in any hospital.

3
00:00:04.843 --> 00:00:08.213
Within the VA, the logistics service performs the role

4
00:00:08.213 --> 00:00:10.219
of supply chain management.

5
00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.930
The biggest expense to hospitals is labor,

6
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.191
or paying for the wages and benefits of staff.

7
00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:18.421
The next biggest expense to hospitals

8
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:20.498
is the cost of the supply chain,

9
00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:23.314
which could be up to 40% of the budget.

10
00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:26.587
As a result, it is important to manage the supply chain

11
00:00:26.587 --> 00:00:28.324
as much as possible.

12
00:00:28.324 --> 00:00:30.354
Logistics staff can make improvements

13
00:00:30.354 --> 00:00:33.393
in their management of their supply chain performance.

14
00:00:33.393 --> 00:00:35.469
Such improvements in supply chain

15
00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.398
can then have indirect improvements

16
00:00:37.398 --> 00:00:39.582
in the other areas of the hospital.

17
00:00:39.582 --> 00:00:42.420
This all leads to sustainability of the hospital

18
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.507
in its performance for patient care.
