00:00:00.716 --> 00:00:03.581
Customer management includes activities employed

2
00:00:03.581 --> 00:00:05.620
in the process to provide customers

3
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.947
with the right items at the right place

4
00:00:07.947 --> 00:00:09.829
and at the right time,

5
00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:11.871
as well as to generate the highest level

6
00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:14.722
of customer satisfaction at the lowest cost

7
00:00:14.722 --> 00:00:17.293
throughout the entire life cycle.

8
00:00:17.293 --> 00:00:19.761
This is accomplished by monitoring usage

9
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:21.093
and working with customers

10
00:00:21.093 --> 00:00:23.999
to understand their needs and requirements.

11
00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:25.620
All of the sections of logistics

12
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.265
work in some form with customer management,

13
00:00:28.265 --> 00:00:32.252
whether setting levels, buying, storing, maintaining,

14
00:00:32.252 --> 00:00:33.980
or delivering supplies.

15
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.564
As a result, it is imperative that all staff

16
00:00:36.564 --> 00:00:37.502
maintain the goal

17
00:00:37.502 --> 00:00:40.594
of providing the best customer service to the patients,

18
00:00:40.594 --> 00:00:43.390
their families, and the clinicians who treat them.
