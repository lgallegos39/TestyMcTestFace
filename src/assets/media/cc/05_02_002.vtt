00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.016
There are systems that are used for data collection

2
00:00:03.016 --> 00:00:06.342
which will measure our key performance indicators.

3
00:00:06.342 --> 00:00:08.492
In the VistA inventory system,

4
00:00:08.492 --> 00:00:11.957
our key performance indicators are turn rate,

5
00:00:11.957 --> 00:00:15.207
long supply, inactive, and null fields.

6
00:00:16.569 --> 00:00:20.538
For instance, the data you input into GIP

7
00:00:20.538 --> 00:00:23.948
has to be accurate, or it can throw off your inventory,

8
00:00:23.948 --> 00:00:26.243
which, in turn, gets reported.

9
00:00:26.243 --> 00:00:29.295
If you enter the wrong price or amount on hand,

10
00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.397
you can throw your on-hand stock

11
00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:34.978
or on-hand dollar amount off by millions of dollars.
