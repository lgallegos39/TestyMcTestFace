00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.709
Let's review an example of the

2
00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.649
negative impact silos can have on a supply chain.

3
00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:07.360
The fiscal department from Medical-

4
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.722
Supplies-R-Us, has always focused on immediate goals.

5
00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:13.699
Every year, they have to cut budgets

6
00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:16.790
by 5% for each service line.

7
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.731
This year the cut will result in

8
00:00:18.731 --> 00:00:21.000
the logistics department, medical surgical

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.760
budget for supplies, dropping from

10
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.869
two million dollars, to 1.9 million dollars.

11
00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.619
The fiscal staff has rolled this

12
00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.428
out and it has become an issue.

13
00:00:31.428 --> 00:00:32.718
Because the fiscal department

14
00:00:32.718 --> 00:00:35.247
did not reach out to any of the service lines,

15
00:00:35.247 --> 00:00:37.579
prior to implementing the budget cuts,

16
00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.169
they do not know that logistics

17
00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:42.460
has had an increase in requests for orders.

18
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.113
A new community-based outpatient clinic,

19
00:00:45.113 --> 00:00:47.612
or CBOC, has opened in an area

20
00:00:47.612 --> 00:00:50.770
that has limited access to the main hospital.

21
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.532
This CBOC was set-up to support

22
00:00:52.532 --> 00:00:55.233
the VA initiatives of increasing enrollees,

23
00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:57.772
or patients, into the system.

24
00:00:57.772 --> 00:00:59.849
As a result, medical supplies and

25
00:00:59.849 --> 00:01:03.750
equipment are needed to support the day-to-day operations.

26
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.211
Logistics anticipates needing

27
00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:10.116
an increase of 5% to support the patient care initiatives.

28
00:01:10.116 --> 00:01:11.972
Due to the silos that exist between

29
00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:14.090
these two services, there is a

30
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.372
clear gap in expectations, which is going to

31
00:01:16.372 --> 00:01:20.172
directly impact performance and patient care.

32
00:01:20.172 --> 00:01:21.799
If logistics does not get to the

33
00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.622
additional funding, they cannot

34
00:01:23.622 --> 00:01:25.982
support the needs of the CBOC.

35
00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:27.530
The equipment and supplies cannot

36
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.932
be purchased to support the mission.

37
00:01:29.932 --> 00:01:32.201
As a result, the patients who live

38
00:01:32.201 --> 00:01:34.299
in rural areas, or areas far away

39
00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:35.791
from the main hospital, will have

40
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:39.164
a difficult time getting basic medical needs met.

41
00:01:39.164 --> 00:01:41.204
Consequently, it is critical to

42
00:01:41.204 --> 00:01:43.032
break down silos and have good

43
00:01:43.032 --> 00:01:46.374
communication among all parts of the organization.

44
00:01:46.374 --> 00:01:48.524
Instead, develop practices that

45
00:01:48.524 --> 00:01:50.993
require communication and collaboration

46
00:01:50.993 --> 00:01:53.124
among all staff, in order to increase

47
00:01:53.124 --> 00:01:55.382
trust and begin to solve the problems

48
00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:57.035
within the organization.
