00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.863
As information shared is upstream and downstream,

2
00:00:03.863 --> 00:00:05.789
the supply chain partners are able to make

3
00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:08.956
better information decisions to reduce costs,

4
00:00:08.956 --> 00:00:10.898
improve quality and flexibility,

5
00:00:10.898 --> 00:00:14.489
and improve the overall service across entire supply chain.

6
00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:18.171
For instance, there will be a new strain for the flu shot.

7
00:00:18.171 --> 00:00:20.128
As a result, there may be an increase

8
00:00:20.128 --> 00:00:23.011
in the population needing vaccinations.

9
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:25.736
If logistics staff shares this with vendors

10
00:00:25.736 --> 00:00:28.206
and vendors share with manufacturers,

11
00:00:28.206 --> 00:00:29.631
then they may be better prepared

12
00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:31.929
to supply the increase in syringes,

13
00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.003
alcohol pads, and any other supporting supplies.
