00:00:00.177 --> 00:00:03.439
If there is inaccurate data in the inventory points,

2
00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:05.353
a negative effect cascades

3
00:00:05.353 --> 00:00:07.740
through the whole inventory system.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.657
For example, let's say the inventory manager

5
00:00:10.657 --> 00:00:13.748
orders 10 cases of medium-sized gloves.

6
00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:16.745
Each case contains 100 boxes of gloves.

7
00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:19.208
The inventory manager gets distracted

8
00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:21.889
and accidentally enters the incorrect information

9
00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:24.737
of the case containing 10 boxes of gloves.

10
00:00:24.737 --> 00:00:27.324
As a result, when the gloves come in,

11
00:00:27.324 --> 00:00:30.445
a total of 100 boxes of gloves are received in

12
00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:34.746
when in reality it would be 1000 boxes of gloves received.

13
00:00:34.746 --> 00:00:39.030
As a result, the primary is short 900 boxes of gloves.

14
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.965
When they are distributed to the secondary areas,

15
00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:44.057
the primary will alert you to order

16
00:00:44.057 --> 00:00:46.444
after the 100 boxes are used,

17
00:00:46.444 --> 00:00:49.663
even if there are 900 boxes still on the shelf.
