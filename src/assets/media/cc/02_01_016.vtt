00:00:00.472 --> 00:00:02.305
If there is a decrease in usage

2
00:00:02.305 --> 00:00:04.911
that has not been communicated to staff,

3
00:00:04.911 --> 00:00:07.752
they may hold on to excess amounts of supplies

4
00:00:07.752 --> 00:00:10.399
assuming that they will eventually be used.

5
00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:12.904
So, if a unit has decreased their use

6
00:00:12.904 --> 00:00:15.870
of small adult diapers, but this is not noticed

7
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.534
by the supply staff, then the unit may end up

8
00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:20.795
with a surplus of diapers they do not need.
