1
00:00:00.437 --> 00:00:03.026
Inventory also plays a significant role

2
00:00:03.026 --> 00:00:04.448
in a supply chain's ability

3
00:00:04.448 --> 00:00:07.030
to support a competitive strategy.

4
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.835
If a business requires a very high level of responsiveness,

5
00:00:09.835 --> 00:00:14.098
the company can use inventory to achieve this responsiveness

6
00:00:14.098 --> 00:00:18.459
by locating large stocks of inventory close to the customer.

7
00:00:18.459 --> 00:00:21.102
In a pull or just-in-time environment,

8
00:00:21.102 --> 00:00:23.925
suppliers may elect to locate inventories

9
00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:27.257
within a customer's stock room with scheduled shipments

10
00:00:27.257 --> 00:00:30.437
on an hourly or minute-by-minute basis.

11
00:00:30.437 --> 00:00:31.463
An extreme case

12
00:00:31.463 --> 00:00:34.818
is a supplier co-locating their specialized manufacturing

13
00:00:34.818 --> 00:00:37.935
within the factory of their customer,

14
00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:41.918
providing instant responsiveness to the customer's demand.

15
00:00:41.918 --> 00:00:44.857
Conversely, a customer can also use inventory

16
00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:47.642
to become more efficient by decreasing inventory

17
00:00:47.642 --> 00:00:50.150
through centralized stocking.

18
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.189
The trade off is efficiency versus responsiveness.

19
00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:56.544
A supply chain manager must make routine decisions

20
00:00:56.544 --> 00:00:59.741
to create a more responsive and more efficient supply chain.

21
00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:03.411
These decisions typically focus on decreasing procurement,

22
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:06.891
repair or deliver recycle inventory, safety inventory,

23
00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:08.808
and seasonal inventory.
