1
00:00:00.525 --> 00:00:02.041
The requester is the person

2
00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:03.335
putting in the order,

3
00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:06.608
and that person's name goes in the requester field.

4
00:00:06.608 --> 00:00:09.201
The originator of request is the individual

5
00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:11.472
asking for the items.

6
00:00:11.472 --> 00:00:14.559
The comments field is another open free text field

7
00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.598
where you can add additional information

8
00:00:16.598 --> 00:00:20.844
regarding delivery location or any special instructions.

9
00:00:20.844 --> 00:00:24.324
At the prompt, would you like to review this request?

10
00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:26.123
It is always best to say yes

11
00:00:26.123 --> 00:00:28.709
and take the opportunity to look over the order

12
00:00:28.709 --> 00:00:32.256
to confirm that the information is input correctly,

13
00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:36.614
such as vendor, items, pricing, and contract number.

14
00:00:36.614 --> 00:00:38.944
For this example, we said no.

15
00:00:38.944 --> 00:00:41.638
After reviewing, if the order is accurate,

16
00:00:41.638 --> 00:00:43.326
answer yes to the prompt,

17
00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:45.805
"Is this request ready for approval?"

18
00:00:45.805 --> 00:00:48.252
The 2237 will then be available

19
00:00:48.252 --> 00:00:51.778
to the control point official, employee three in this case,

20
00:00:51.778 --> 00:00:53.290
for approval and signature.
