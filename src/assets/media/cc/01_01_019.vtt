00:00:00.301 --> 00:00:02.169
If there is a decrease in usage

2
00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:04.953
that has not been communicated to staff,

3
00:00:04.953 --> 00:00:07.757
they may hold onto excess amounts of supplies,

4
00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:10.467
assuming that they will eventually be used.

5
00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:12.736
So if a unit has decreased their use

6
00:00:12.736 --> 00:00:14.457
of small adult diapers,

7
00:00:14.457 --> 00:00:17.061
but this is not noticed by the supply staff,

8
00:00:17.061 --> 00:00:18.364
then the unit may end up

9
00:00:18.364 --> 00:00:20.843
with a surplus of diapers they do not need.
